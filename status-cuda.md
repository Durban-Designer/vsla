# VSLA CUDA Backend Development Status

## Current State

Development of the CUDA backend is underway, following the detailed mathematical and implementation specification provided in `docs/vsla_spec_v_3.1.md`.

## Progress Made

*   **Specification Alignment:** The `vsla_backend_cuda.c` file has been refactored to align with the new context-based API and the `vsla_backend_interface_t` contract.
*   **Memory Management:**
    *   `cuda_allocate`: Implemented to allocate GPU memory based on tensor capacity.
    *   `cuda_deallocate`: Implemented to free GPU memory.
    *   `cuda_copy_to_device`: Implemented (currently a no-op as data is assumed to be on device after allocation).
    *   `cuda_copy_to_host`: Implemented to copy data from GPU to CPU.
    *   `cuda_synchronize`: Implemented to synchronize CUDA device operations.
*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations (Kernel Wrappers):**
    *   `cuda_fill`: Implemented to call the corresponding CUDA kernel.
    *   `cuda_add`: Implemented to call the corresponding CUDA kernel.
    *   `cuda_sub`: Implemented to call the corresponding CUDA kernel.
    *   `cuda_scale`: Implemented to call the corresponding CUDA kernel.
    *   `cuda_hadamard`: Implemented to call the corresponding CUDA kernel.
    *   `cuda_sum`: Implemented to call the corresponding CUDA kernel.
*   **CUDA Kernel Files:**
    *   `src/backends/cuda/vsla_backend_cuda_kernels.h`: Cleaned up duplicate function declarations.
    *   `src/backends/cuda/vsla_backend_cuda_kernels.cu`: Updated to use `vsla_tensor_numel` and `vsla_tensor_get_gpu_data` for data access.
*   **Core Library Updates:**
    *   `src/vsla_unified.c`: Updated to correctly handle backend selection and `vsla_tensor_copy_to_host` calls.
    *   `src/vsla_tensor.c`: Updated with correct function signatures for tensor property accessors (`vsla_get_rank`, `vsla_get_shape`, etc.) and `vsla_get_f64`, `vsla_set_f64`.
    *   `src/vsla_tensor_utils.c` and `include/vsla/vsla_tensor_utils.h`: Created to house `vsla_tensor_get_gpu_data` to resolve circular dependencies.
*   **Test Framework:**
    *   `tests/test_clean_architecture.c`: Modified to accept `--backend` command-line argument for backend selection.
    *   `tests/test_arithmetic_unified.c`: Modified to include `vsla_tensor_copy_to_device` before operations and `vsla_tensor_copy_to_host` before result verification for CUDA backend.

## Current Challenges / Blockers

The `UnifiedTests_CUDA` tests are currently failing. The test logs indicate that while the CUDA backend is being selected and the kernels are being invoked, the numerical results are incorrect (often `0.0000000000` where non-zero values are expected). This suggests:

1.  **Data Transfer Issues:** Data might not be correctly transferred from CPU host memory to GPU device memory before kernel execution.
2.  **Kernel Implementation Issues:** The CUDA kernels themselves might not be correctly performing the operations, or there might be issues with how they access or write data to global memory.
3.  **Data Retrieval Issues:** Data might not be correctly transferred back from GPU device memory to CPU host memory for verification.

Further debugging is required to pinpoint the exact cause of the numerical discrepancies. The `printf` statements added to `cuda_copy_to_host_wrapper` are not appearing in the test logs, which is a strong indicator that the `vsla_tensor_copy_to_host` function is either not being called or is failing silently before the `printf` is reached.

## Next Steps

1.  **Deep Dive into Data Transfer:** Investigate why `vsla_tensor_copy_to_host` (and potentially `vsla_tensor_copy_to_device`) is not functioning as expected or why its `printf` output is not visible. This might involve adding more granular `printf` statements within the `cuda_copy_to_host` and `cuda_copy_to_device` functions, or using CUDA's error checking more aggressively.
2.  **Verify Kernel Execution:** Once data transfer is confirmed, verify the correctness of the CUDA kernels themselves by inspecting intermediate results if possible.
