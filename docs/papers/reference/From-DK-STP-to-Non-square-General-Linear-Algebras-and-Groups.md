## Summary

This paper proposes a new matrix product called the dimension-keeping semi-tensor product (DK-STP). This new product generalizes the classical matrix product to be dimension-free.

Under the DK-STP, the set of m x n matrices forms a semi-group and a ring. This allows for the extension of important concepts typically reserved for square matrices to non-square matrices. These concepts include:
*   Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
*   Determinant and invertibility
*   The Cayley-Hamilton theory

The paper also defines a Lie bracket, which turns the set of m x n matrices into a Lie algebra, referred to as the non-square or STP general linear algebra. Furthermore, a corresponding Lie group, the non-square or STP general linear group, is constructed. The paper explores the relationship between these non-square structures and the classical general linear group and algebra.
