## Summary

This paper explores the use of the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices in finite game theory. The paper provides a survey of this relatively new and promising approach. The survey begins with an introduction to both STP and finite games, and then explains the fundamental principles and techniques of applying STP to these games. It covers various problems and recent findings in the theory and application of finite games using the STP approach. The paper also touches on the potential application of STP in the field of artificial intelligence.
