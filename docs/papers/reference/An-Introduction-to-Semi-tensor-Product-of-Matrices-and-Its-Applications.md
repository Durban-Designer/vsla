## Summary

This book serves as a comprehensive introduction to the topic of Semi-Tensor Product (STP) of matrices, covering its theoretical underpinnings and a wide array of applications. The STP is a generalization of the conventional matrix product that allows for the multiplication of two matrices where the dimensions do not need to match in the traditional sense. The book details the theory and applications of STP in various fields, including Boolean networks, nonlinear systems, fuzzy logic, and game theory.
