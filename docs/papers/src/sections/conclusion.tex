\section{Conclusion}
Dimensionâ€‘aware computation replaces brittle padding with algebraic rigor.  VSLA unifies flexible data shapes with efficient algorithms, promising advances across adaptive AI, signal processing and beyond. By establishing a formal, object-centric algebraic system, VSLA provides a principled foundation for the next generation of dynamic computational frameworks, complementing existing approaches like STP and offering a rigorous alternative to ad-hoc engineering solutions.
