\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\subsection{Theoretical Performance Analysis}
This section presents theoretical performance characteristics of VSLA operations based on complexity analysis and preliminary implementation studies. The results demonstrate the potential advantages of the mathematical framework, though comprehensive benchmarking against production tensor libraries remains future work.

\textbf{Analysis Framework:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item \textbf{Complexity Models:} Theoretical analysis based on Theorems \ref{thm:complexity} and \ref{thm:polyIso}.
\item \textbf{Memory Models:} Analysis of VSLA's sparse-by-design storage versus traditional padding approaches.
\item \textbf{Proof-of-Concept:} Basic implementations validating the fundamental algorithmic approaches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theoretical Performance Projections}

Based on complexity analysis and algorithmic design, VSLA operations are expected to provide significant performance advantages over traditional approaches:

\textbf{Asymptotic Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item \textbf{FFT-Accelerated Convolution:} Model A achieves $\mathcal{O}(mn d_{\max} \log d_{\max})$ complexity versus $\mathcal{O}(mn d_{\max}^2)$ for naive approaches.
\item \textbf{Sparse Memory Model:} Storage requirements scale with actual data size rather than padded dimensions, providing memory reductions proportional to sparsity levels.
\item \textbf{Shape-Aware Operations:} Elimination of unnecessary computations on artificial zeros in traditional padding approaches.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Scalability Analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:scaling} demonstrates VSLA's scaling behavior across increasing tensor dimensions and sparsity levels. The FFT-accelerated convolution model shows particular strength in high-dimensional scenarios, maintaining sub-quadratic complexity even with heterogeneous shapes, a direct result of the algebraic properties established in Theorem~\ref{thm:polyIso}.

\subsection{Implementation Status}
The current VSLA implementation provides:

\textbf{Core Library:} A C17 implementation with Python bindings supporting the fundamental VSLA operations (addition, multiplication, convolution) and shape promotion algorithms.

\textbf{Prototype Integrations:} Basic proof-of-concept demonstrations showing VSLA operations can be integrated with existing tensor frameworks, though full production integrations remain future work.

\textbf{Benchmarking Framework:} Synthetic test suites validating the theoretical performance characteristics, with results shown in the tables above using simulated workloads representative of real applications.
