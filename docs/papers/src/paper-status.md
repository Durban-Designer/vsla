## Planned Response to First Peer Review (v0.2)

### Critical Actions Required
1. **Complete missing proofs** (M1):
   - Theorem 4.4: Full Cauchy completion argument with topology clarification
   - Theorem 6.3: Rigorous associativity proof for stacking operator
   - All sketched proofs expanded to full rigor

2. **Production-grade documentation** (M4-M7):
   - Thread safety specifications and locking strategy
   - Zero-dimension edge case handling
   - Autodiff VJP formal statements
   - GitHub release with DOI/version tags

### Mathematical Enhancements
3. **Algebraic context** (M8):
   - Compare VSLA to graded rings, Rees algebras
   - Position in algebraic landscape

4. **Technical polish**:
   - Fix notation overload and typos
   - Improve figure accessibility
   - Update references to latest versions
   - Add security considerations

## Benchmarking Issues (BLOCKED - Library Rewrite in Progress)

**Issues M2, M3 from peer review** regarding comprehensive benchmarking and baseline fairness are currently **BLOCKED** pending completion of the C library rewrite.

### Current Status
- The existing C99 library implementation needs architectural improvements for hot-swapping hardware backends (CPU, CUDA, ROCm, etc.)
- We are currently rewriting the core library to support:
  - Pluggable hardware backends 
  - Unified API across CPU/GPU implementations
  - Fair performance comparisons against state-of-the-art libraries
  - Thread-safe operation across different hardware

### Benchmarking Requirements (Deferred)
- **M2. GPU throughput numbers:** CUDA/ROCm implementations
- **M3. Fair baseline comparisons:** TensorFlow Ragged GPU vs VSLA GPU on equivalent hardware
- Include comparisons with torch-sparse, tvot libraries
- Wall-clock vs asymptotic scaling studies
- Sparse vs dense performance analysis

### Decision
**We will not modify the benchmarking sections of the paper until the library rewrite is complete.** This ensures:
1. All performance claims are backed by the production architecture
2. Fair comparisons using equivalent hardware backends
3. No need to update benchmarks multiple times during development

The theoretical contributions (proofs, mathematical rigor, algebraic context) can be completed independently and represent the core scientific value of the work.

## Second Peer Review Received (July 18, 2025) - v0.2 Assessment

**Reviewer Profile:** Computational mathematician (Ph.D.), C/C99 scientific libraries author, >30 journal papers.

**Overall Assessment:** Major revision required. Theoretical foundation now sound; acceptance hinges on empirical completeness and presentation fixes.

### Major Strengths Noted in v0.2
- **Mathematical maturity:** Full proofs close largest theoretical gaps from round 1
- **Implementation realism:** API fragments, memory layout details, FFT pseudocode make engineering story convincing  
- **Clarity & organization:** Improved roadmap and consistent numbering enhance readability

### Status of Previous Major Issues (M1-M8)

#### Resolved Issues ✓
- **M1. Proof completeness:** Theorems 4.4 and 6.3 now complete ✓ (minor absolute convergence clarification needed)
- **M4. Zero-dimensional semantics:** Lemma 7.2 covers 0-degree behavior ✓
- **M6. Autodiff validity:** VJP sketch with PyTorch example added ✓ (needs minimal-storage proof)
- **M8. Algebraic context:** New §4.2 compares to graded rings/Rees algebras ✓

#### Still Outstanding ✗
- **M2. GPU throughput numbers:** Still CPU-only benchmarks, no CUDA/ROCm data ✗
- **M3. Baseline fairness:** Missing TF-Ragged/NestedTensor GPU comparisons ✗
- **M5. Thread safety details:** Still one sentence, no locks/atomics description ✗
- **M7. DOI/version tag:** GitHub link added but no commit hash or Zenodo archive ✗

### New Issues Identified in v0.2
1. **Notation clash:** `deg` vs `vdim` inconsistency persists
2. **Minor typos:** Eq.(6) summation index duplication, Figure 2 caption mismatch
3. **Layout issues:** Algorithm 1 overruns ACM two-column width
4. **Security details:** `aligned_alloc(64, size)` is C11; older systems need `posix_memalign`
5. **Missing references:** License not stated in paper text, outdated TensorFlow citation
6. **Figure 3:** Missing axis units and labels

## Workflow Notes

- Main development happens on `vsla_paper.tex`
- ACM version (`vsla_paper_acm.tex`) only updated at major milestones
- This avoids maintaining two versions during active development
- See `PAPER_GUIDE.md` for detailed version management instructions
