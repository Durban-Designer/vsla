# Paper Status

This document tracks the status of the updates to the VSLA paper based on peer review feedback.

## First Peer Review Received (July 18, 2025)

**Reviewer Profile:** Research mathematician (Ph.D., applied algebra), 10 years C/C99 numerical libraries experience, >30 peer-reviewed papers in scientific computing.

**Overall Assessment:** Revision required. Promising work that could merit acceptance with stronger empirical validation and fuller proofs.

## Second Peer Review Received (July 18, 2025) - v0.2 Assessment

**Reviewer Profile:** Computational mathematician (Ph.D.), C/C99 scientific libraries author, >30 journal papers.

**Overall Assessment:** Major revision required. Theoretical foundation now sound; acceptance hinges on empirical completeness and presentation fixes.

## Third Peer Review Received (July 19, 2025) - v0.3 Assessment

**Reviewer Profile:** Expert in mathematical notation, formal systems, and history of algebraic structures.

**Overall Assessment:** Major revision required. The paper presents a novel and powerful algebraic system, but its formal coherence is undermined by inconsistent notation. Claims of novelty for core operators must be carefully contextualized with respect to prior art. Adopting a systematic "calculus" of notation and citing related work is essential for the paper to be read as a mature formal system.

## Progress Update (July 19, 2025)

Significant progress has been made on the v0.4 revision. Key accomplishments include:
- **Complete Restructure:** The paper has been reorganized into a multi-file LaTeX project for better manageability.
- **STP Integration:** The novelty of VSLA has been clearly articulated in relation to STP, with a dedicated comparison section and citations.
- **Future Collaboration:** The "Future Work" section now includes potential synergies between VSLA and STP.
- **Empirical Rigor:** The "Experimental Results" section has been updated with more precise, statistically-grounded claims.

## Major Update Completed (July 20, 2025) - v0.45

**Operator Notation Consistency Achieved:** Successfully implemented comprehensive operator notation standardization throughout the entire paper addressing the v0.3 reviewer's primary concern about mathematical formalism.

### Key Accomplishments:
- **✓ Complete Operator Macro System:** Added comprehensive LaTeX macros for all mathematical operators (Stack, Wstack, Pyr, shape, vdim, amb, prom, minrep, rev, unprom, unstack, cost, nnz)
- **✓ Systematic Notation Updates:** Updated all mathematical expressions throughout all sections to use consistent operator notation
- **✓ Formal Operator Definitions:** Added rigorous mathematical definitions for ambient shape, promotion, and minimal representative operators
- **✓ VJP Formula Updates:** Modernized all Vector-Jacobian Product formulas in gradients section with proper operator notation
- **✓ Successful Compilation:** Paper compiles cleanly (25 pages) with all references resolved and no mathematical errors

### Impact:
This update directly addresses the v0.3 reviewer's core criticism: *"formal coherence is undermined by inconsistent notation"* and *"Adopting a systematic 'calculus' of notation...is essential for the paper to be read as a mature formal system."* The paper now presents a unified, professional mathematical notation system that enhances readability and mathematical rigor.
