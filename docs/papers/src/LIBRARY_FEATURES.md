# VSLA Library Features

This document tracks the features mentioned in the research papers that need to be implemented or are planned for the C99 library with Python bindings.

## Core Architecture Features (Claims from Paper)

### Memory Management
- [x] **64-byte aligned memory allocation** for optimal cache performance
- [x] **Power-of-2 capacity growth** minimizes reallocation overhead  
- [x] **Sparse-aware algorithms** avoid materializing padding zeros
- [ ] **Zero-copy operations** (needs implementation verification)
- [ ] **Memory-mapped I/O** for processing datasets larger than RAM

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] **SIMD optimization** (basic implementation exists)
- [ ] **Thread-safe operations** with lock-free data structures
- [ ] **Custom allocators** for HPC environments supporting huge pages and memory pools
- [ ] **Automatic NUMA topology detection** and memory placement

### Core Operations
- [x] **FFT-accelerated convolution** for Model A (convolution semiring)
- [x] **Kronecker products** for Model B (non-commutative semiring)
- [x] **Automatic shape promotion** preserves sparsity during operations
- [x] **Stacking operator** (Σ_k) for building higher-rank tensors
- [x] **Window-stacking operator** (Ω_w) for tensor pyramids

### Transform Operations for Sparse Simulation
- [ ] **VS_SCATTER** for particle-in-cell methods
- [ ] **VS_GATHER** for variable-sized grid cell operations  
- [ ] **VS_PERMUTE** for reorienting computational kernels without data copying
- [ ] **VS_RESHAPE** for switching between physical and computational representations

## Python Integration

### NumPy Compatibility
- [x] **NumPy-compatible API** handles variable-shape tensors transparently
- [x] **Automatic shape promotion** preserves sparsity during operations
- [ ] **Drop-in NumPy replacements** for variable-shape data (partial implementation)

### Performance Claims Made in Paper
- **3-5× speedups** in convolution operations vs zero-padding
- **62-68% memory reduction** vs traditional approaches  
- **3-5× memory efficiency** over traditional approaches

## Development Status

### Implemented
- Basic C99 core with semiring operations
- Python bindings for core functionality
- FFT-based convolution (Model A)
- Kronecker products (Model B)
- Memory-efficient sparse storage

### In Development
- Advanced transform operations (VS_SCATTER, VS_GATHER, etc.)
- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Memory-mapped I/O support
- Custom allocators for HPC

### Planned
- Production-ready thread safety
- NUMA-aware memory placement
- Enterprise-grade allocators
- Comprehensive benchmarking suite

## Notes

This library provides **C99 base implementation with Python bindings**. Any future language bindings (Julia, Rust, etc.) will be community-driven contributions.

All performance claims in the research paper should be verified through comprehensive benchmarking once the implementation is complete.
