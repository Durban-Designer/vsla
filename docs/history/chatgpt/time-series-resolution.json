            "I'm working on my paper and had an interesting idea today while pondering its capacity to use the stacking operator to roll time series data into larger tensors. It made me think \"What if we use multiple time resolutions simultaneously as in take the tensor of one time step, a pyramid of 10 time steps, and a pyramid of 50 time steps and pass each as an input to a different section of a neural network.\" Then we have it consider each resolution together to come to a conclusion on the data. \n\nBut I also wonder if just using the 50 time step tensor would acomplish that? Perhaps its better to have each type use a seperate initial model that comes to a conclusion and then a master model takes in all 3 inputs? Maybe larger pyramids run slower and smaller ones faster to simulate fast reflex vs. deep thinking?"

            "Variable-Shape Linear Algebra: Mathematical Foundations and\r\nHigh-Performance Implementation\r\nRoyce Birnbaum\r\nJuly 19, 2025\r\nAbstract\r\nVariable-Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA) treats dimension as intrinsic data, enabling\r\nautomatic shape promotion while preserving algebraic structure. This paper formalizes\r\nVSLA through equivalence classes of finite-dimensional vectors and develops two complete\r\nsemiring instantiations: convolution and Kronecker products. We introduce the stacking\r\noperator S that builds higher-rank tensors from variable-shape collections, forming ten\u0002sor pyramids for streaming applications. The mathematical foundation builds on classical\r\npolynomial ring theory and formal power series [von zur Gathen and Gerhard, 2013], while\r\nthe dual semiring approach extends traditional matrix algebra [Horn and Johnson, 2012,\r\nGondran and Minoux, 2008]. While Cheng’s Semi-Tensor Product (STP) first generalized\r\nmatrix products for mismatched dimensions [Cheng, 2001], VSLA offers a distinct, com\u0002plementary approach founded on equivalence classes and dual semiring models, leading to\r\na sparse-by-design memory model. Complexity analysis shows FFT convolution preserves\r\nO(mndmax log dmax) efficiency using established fast multiplication algorithms [Cooley and Tukey, 1965].\r\nUnlike existing ragged tensor frameworks [Abadi et al., 2024, Paszke et al., 2023, Ansel et al., 2022],\r\nVSLA provides mathematically rigorous structures with provable algebraic identities, en\u0002abling principled computation for adaptive AI architectures, sensor fusion, and scientific\r\ncomputing.\r\nKeywords: Variable-shape tensors, stacking operator, tensor pyramids, semiring algebra, au\u0002tomatic differentiation, high-performance computing, adaptive neural networks, sensor fusion,\r\nsparse computing, semi-tensor product\r\nMSC: 15A69, 68W30, 65F05, 16Y60\r\n1 Context and Motivation\r\n1.1 The Dimension Problem\r\nTraditional linear algebra fixes dimensions m, n a priori. Contemporary challenges—adaptive\r\nneural networks, multi-resolution signal analysis, dynamic meshes—demand structures whose\r\nshapes evolve in real time. This fundamental mismatch between static mathematical frameworks\r\nand dynamic computational needs creates significant barriers to progress in emerging fields.\r\nRunning Example: Consider training a convolutional neural network where filter widths\r\nadapt dynamically based on input complexity. A standard 3 × 3 convolution kernel K1 =\r\n[1, −1, 2] might expand to K2 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 1] for high-resolution features. Traditional frame\u0002works require manual padding: K′\r\n1 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 0] before operations, losing semantic informa\u0002tion and incurring unnecessary computation on artificial zeros.\r\nThe core mathematical challenge lies in reconciling algebraic rigor with computational flex\u0002ibility. While prior work such as the Semi-Tensor Product (STP) of matrices [Cheng, 2001]\r\n1",

            "provided a powerful mechanism for multiplying dimension-mismatched matrices via Kronecker\u0002based lifting, VSLA arises from a different motivation: defining a rigorous algebraic system for\r\nvariable-dimension objects themselves. VSLA’s equivalence-class abstraction avoids materializ\u0002ing padded zeros and supplies dual semiring models oriented toward convolutional (polynomial)\r\nand Kronecker (tensor growth) behaviors.\r\n1.2 Limitations of Current Approaches\r\nExisting frameworks fail to provide both mathematical rigor and computational flexibility:\r\n• TensorFlow Ragged Tensors: Handle variable-length sequences but lack rigorous alge\u0002braic structure and semiring properties.\r\n• PyTorch NestedTensors: Provide dynamic shapes but without mathematical guarantees\r\nor efficient sparse representations.\r\n• Manual zero-padding: Obscures mathematical structure, wastes computation, and lacks\r\nprovable algebraic identities.\r\n1.3 The VSLA Solution\r\nVSLA incorporates the shape directly into every algebraic object through mathematically rigor\u0002ous equivalence classes. Operations such as addition or convolution implicitly coerce operands\r\nto a common dimension while preserving sparsity and algebraic properties. In our example,\r\nK1 ⊕ K2 = [2, −2, 4, 0, 1] automatically, with provable semiring laws and efficient sparse com\u0002putation.\r\nCore Innovation: Rather than forcing all tensors into fixed dimensions, VSLA treats\r\ndimension as intrinsic data through equivalence classes (d, v) ∼ (d\r\n′\r\n, v′) when their zero-padded\r\nextensions match. This enables automatic shape promotion: (3, [1, −1, 2])+ (5, [3, 0, −1, 1, 2]) =\r\n(5, [4, −1, 1, 1, 2]) without explicit padding operations.\r\nMathematical Rigor: VSLA operations form semiring structures enabling algebraic ma\u0002nipulation while preserving computational efficiency. Two instantiations provide different com\u0002putational trade-offs: convolution semiring (O(mndmax log dmax)) and Kronecker semiring (O(mnd2\r\nmax)).\r\nPractical Impact: Variable-shape computation eliminates memory waste from artificial\r\npadding, enables adaptive neural architectures, and provides mathematical foundations for\r\nemerging applications in multi-sensor fusion, quantum simulation, and edge computing.\r\n1.4 Roadmap\r\nThis paper proceeds as follows: §2 establishes mathematical preliminaries; §3–§5 develop two\r\nsemiring models with complete proofs; §6 introduces the stacking operator and tensor pyra\u0002mid constructions; §6.4–§7 bridge theory to implementation; §8 extends to advanced sparse\r\nsimulation operations; §9–§10 provide empirical validation and context.\r\n2",

A ring R is graded if it can be written as a direct sum\r\nR =\r\nL\r\nn≥0 Rn such that RmRn ⊆ Rm+n. For R[x], the graded components are the subspaces\r\nof homogeneous polynomials of degree n, i.e., Rn = span(x\r\nn\r\n). The VSLA ”degree” corresponds\r\ndirectly to the polynomial degree, and the convolution operation corresponds to polynomial\r\nmultiplication, which respects the grading.\r\nRees Algebra: The Rees algebra (or blow-up algebra) associated with an ideal I of a ring\r\nR is defined as R(I) = L\r\nn≥0\r\nI\r\nn\r\nt\r\nn ⊆ R[t]. While not a direct equivalent, the VSLA framework\r\nshares the spirit of the Rees algebra by tracking ”powers” of some fundamental structure. In\r\nVSLA, the ”ideal” can be thought of as the space of all possible vector extensions, and the\r\n”degree” of a VSLA element tracks how ”large” an extension is needed. The key difference is\r\nthat VSLA is built on a semiring and focuses on computational aspects of variable-length data,\r\nwhereas the Rees algebra is a tool in commutative algebra for studying the structure of ideals.\r\nBy framing VSLA in this context, we see that it is not an ad-hoc construction but rather a\r\ncomputationally-oriented realization of well-understood algebraic objects, tailored to the specific\r\nchallenges of variable-shape data in high-performance computing.\r\nTheorem 4.4 (Completion). Equip D with the norm ∥[(d, v)]∥1 := Pd\r\ni=1 |vi\r\n|. The Cauchy\r\ncompletion of (D, ∥·∥1) is isometrically isomorphic to the Banach space ℓ\r\n1\r\n(N0) of absolutely\r\nsummable sequences, which is a subspace of the formal power series ring R[[x]]. This extends\r\nclassical results on polynomial ring completions [Rudin, 1991, von zur Gathen and Gerhard, 2013]\r\nto the variable-dimension setting.\r\nProof. We provide a complete proof with topological clarification.\r\n1. The Normed Space: The map ∥·∥1 : D → R≥0 is a well-defined norm. The isomorphism\r\nΦ : D → R[x] from Theorem 4.3 allows us to view D as the space of polynomials. For a\r\npolynomial p(x) = Pd−1\r\ni=0 aix\r\ni\r\n, the norm is ∥p∥1 =\r\nPd−1\r\ni=0 |ai\r\n|. This is the standard ℓ\r\n1\r\n-norm on\r\nthe coefficients.\r\n6",

For any ϵ > 0, there exists N such that\r\nfor n, m > N, ∥pn − pm∥1 < ϵ. Let pn(x) = Pvdim(pn)\r\ni=0 an,ix\r\ni\r\n. The norm condition implies that\r\nfor each fixed coefficient index i, the sequence of real numbers (an,i)n∈N is a Cauchy sequence\r\nin R. This is because |an,i − am,i| ≤ P\r\nj\r\n|an,j − am,j | = ∥pn − pm∥1 < ϵ.\r\n3. The Limit Object: Since R is complete, each sequence (an,i)n converges to a limit ai ∈ R.\r\nWe define the limit object in the completion as the formal power series p(x) = P∞\r\ni=0 aix\r\ni\r\n.\r\n4. The Completion Space: We must show that this limit object p(x) is in the space ℓ\r\n1\r\n(N0),\r\ni.e., P∞\r\ni=0 |ai\r\n| < ∞. Since (pn) n is a Cauchy sequence, it is bounded: there exists M > 0 such\r\nthat ∥pn∥1 ≤ M for all n. For any finite K,\r\nPK\r\ni=0 |an,i| ≤ M. Taking the limit as n → ∞, we\r\nget PK\r\ni=0 |ai\r\n| ≤ M. Since this holds for all K, the series P∞\r\ni=0 |ai\r\nP\r\n| converges absolutely with\r\n∞\r\ni=0 |ai\r\n| ≤ M < ∞, confirming that p(x) is in ℓ\r\n1\r\n(N0).\r\n5. Isomorphism: The completion of (R[x], ∥·∥1) is the Banach space ℓ\r\n1\r\n(N0). The map Φ\r\nextends to an isometric isomorphism from the completion of D to ℓ\r\n1\r\n(N0).

In\r\nquantum computing, the state of a multi-qubit system is described by the Kronecker product\r\nof single-qubit states, and the order of the product is significant. Similarly, in tensor network\r\nmethods for simulating many-body quantum systems, such as Matrix Product States (MPS) or\r\nProjected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), the non-commutative nature of the Kronecker product\r\nis fundamental to capturing the entanglement structure of the system. In these domains, VSLA’s\r\nModel B provides a natural and efficient framework for representing and manipulating these\r\nnon-commutative structures, especially when the constituent systems have different dimensions.\r\nProposition 5.3. x ⊗K y = y ⊗K x iff vdim x = 1 or vdim y = 1 (i.e. one operand is scalar).\r\nLemma 5.4 (ScalarCommutation). If x = α 1 with α ∈ R then x ⊗K y = y ⊗K x for all y ∈ D.\r\nProof. Both products equal α y by definition. □\r\n6 Stacking Operator and Tensor Pyramids\r\nThis section introduces a major theoretical extension to VSLA: the stacking operator S that\r\nbuilds higher-rank tensors from collections of lower-rank tensors, and the window-stacking op\u0002erator W for constructing tensor pyramids from streaming data.\r\n6.1 The Stacking Operator S\r\nDefinition 6.1 (Stacking Operator).

Distributivity over + and ⊙: For semiring operations, stacking distributes over element\u0002wise operations after promotion to common ambient shape.\r\nProof. (1) Associativity: We provide a more rigorous proof. Let Ai = (A\r\n(i)\r\n1\r\n, . . . , A(i)\r\nki\r\n) be m lists\r\nof rank-r tensors. Let K =\r\nPm\r\ni=1 ki\r\n.\r\nThe left-hand side is L = Sm(Sk1(A1), . . . , Skm(Am)). Let ni be the ambient shape for\r\neach inner stack Ski(Ai), and let N be the ambient shape for the outer stack. Then Nj =\r\nmaxi=1...m(ni)j . The resulting tensor L has rank r + 2 and shape (m, N).\r\nThe right-hand side is R = SK(A1, . . . , Am). Let the ambient shape for this combined stack\r\nbe N′. By definition, N′\r\nj = maxi,j vdim(A\r\n(i)\r\nj\r\n) = maxi(maxj vdim(A\r\n(i)\r\nj\r\n)) = maxi(ni)j = Nj .

The elements\r\nof R are given by (R)l,... where l indexes the concatenated list of all A tensors. There is a\r\ncanonical mapping from the double index (i, j) to the single index l that preserves the order\r\nof the tensors. Since the padding is to the same ambient shape N, the resulting tensors are\r\nidentical up to a reshape of the leading axes from (m, k1, . . . , km) to a single flattened axis of\r\nsize K.\r\n(2) Neutral-zero absorption: Zero representatives in VSLA have the form [(d, 0)] where 0\r\nis the zero vector. In the stacked output, these contribute blocks of zeros which preserve the\r\nzero-padding equivalence relation by definition.\r\n(3) Distributivity: Given tensors A(i) and B(i) and operation ◦ ∈ {+, ⊙}, we have Sk(A(1) ◦\r\nB(1), . . .) = Sk(A(1), . . .) ◦ Sk(B(1), . . .) after promoting all operands to the common ambient\r\nshape, since ◦ operates element-wise within blocks. □\r\nProposition 6.4 (Monoidal Category Structure). The triple (Tr, +, S) forms a strict monoidal\r\ncategory where S is the tensor product on objects of type “list of rank-r tensors”.\r\nProof. A strict monoidal category consists of:\r\n1. A category C.\r\n2. A bifunctor ⊗ : C × C → C, called the tensor product.\r\n3. An identity object I ∈ C.\r\n4. The tensor product is strictly associative: (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C = A ⊗ (B ⊗ C).\r\n5.

            "7.3 Security Considerations\r\nVSLA’s dynamic nature introduces security considerations, primarily related to resource man\u0002agement and data validation. Maliciously crafted inputs with extremely large or pathological\r\nshape metadata could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by triggering excessive memory\r\nallocation or computation.\r\nTo mitigate these risks, the VSLA C-library implementation includes several safeguards:\r\n• Shape Validation: All input tensors have their shape metadata rigorously validated.\r\nThis includes checks for excessive dimension sizes, and rank mismatches. The library\r\nimposes a configurable maximum on the total number of elements to prevent pathological\r\nmemory allocation.\r\n• Resource Limiting: The API allows callers to specify resource limits, such as a max\u0002imum memory footprint for any single operation. This prevents a single user or process\r\nfrom exhausting system resources.\r\n• Integer Overflow Protection: All internal arithmetic for calculating memory offsets\r\nand sizes is checked for integer overflows, a common source of vulnerabilities in C/C++\r\ncode.\r\nThese measures ensure that while VSLA provides flexibility, it does not compromise the\r\nstability or security of the systems it runs on.\r\nImplementation Status: The current VSLA library provides a single-threaded CPU im\u0002plementation requiring C11 (minimum standard) for aligned memory allocation and atomic\r\noperations support.

FFT-based convolu\u0002tion [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] achieves O(dmax log dmax) per-element complexity, while Karat\u0002suba multiplication [Karatsuba and Ofman, 1962] and more sophisticated approaches [Cantor and Kaltofen, 199\r\noffer alternative trade-offs for moderate degrees. Model B’s quadratic complexity in dmax reflects\r\nthe fundamental cost of Kronecker product computation. While block-structured approaches\r\ncould potentially reduce this complexity, the variable-shape nature of VSLA entries complicates\r\nsuch optimizations, as standard blocking assumptions may not hold uniformly across heteroge\u0002neous tensor elements.\r\nParallel Implementations: VSLA’s memory model, which avoids storing explicit zeros, is\r\nhighly amenable to parallelization. The sparse nature of the data means that many operations\r\ncan be decomposed into independent sub-problems. For example, element-wise operations on\r\nVSLA tensors can be parallelized by distributing the non-zero blocks of data across multiple\r\nprocessing units. The main challenge is load balancing, as the variable shapes can lead to\r\nunevenly sized computational tasks. The explicit dimension metadata in VSLA tensors can be\r\nused to inform intelligent scheduling and data distribution strategies to mitigate this. Future\r\nwork will explore implementations using OpenMP for multi-core CPUs and CUDA/ROCm for\r\nGPUs, focusing on sparse data structures and asynchronous memory transfers to hide latency.\r\n8 Advanced Operations for Sparse Simulation\r\nBeyond the foundational semiring operations, the VSLA framework is particularly well-suited\r\nfor advanced simulations, especially those involving sparse or dynamically changing data. This\r\nsection explores how VSLA’s design principles can be extended to support complex data trans\u0002forms and movements within tensors, which are critical for such simulations.\r\n8.1 VSLA for Enhanced Sparse Computation in Simulations\r\nVSLA’s fundamental design principles — treating dimension as intrinsic data and employing\r\nzero-padding equivalence — inherently enable superior sparse computation in simulations com\u000216",

            "pared to traditional fixed-dimension approaches (see Section 3).\r\n• Implicit Sparsity Handling: Unlike existing frameworks that necessitate manual padding,\r\nVSLA operations (e.g., addition, convolution) automatically coerce operands to compati\u0002ble shapes while rigorously preserving sparsity. This means that implicit trailing zeros are\r\nnever materialized or explicitly computed, leading to significant computational savings.\r\n• Memory Efficiency for Sparse Data: VSLA tensors store only the ”minimal represen\u0002tative” of each equivalence class, effectively avoiding the storage of explicit trailing zeros,\r\nas described in our memory model (Section 7.2). For a tensor with a large logical shape\r\nbut sparse data, the storage complexity is bounded by the sum of minimal representatives\r\nrather than the ambient shape.\r\n• Optimized Algorithms: The formalization of VSLA with semiring structures allows for\r\nthe development of tailored, efficient algorithms. For instance, FFT-accelerated convolu\u0002tion in Model A maintains O(mndmax log dmax) efficiency even with heterogeneous shapes\r\n(Theorem 6.12), demonstrating a concrete advantage over naive O(mnd2\r\nmax) approaches\r\nfor sparse convolution-heavy simulations.\r\nThis intrinsic efficiency makes VSLA particularly well-suited for diverse simulation scenarios\r\nwhere data often exhibits dynamic shapes or high sparsity, such as adaptive mesh refinement,\r\nagent-based models, or particle simulations where elements might appear or disappear.\r\n8.2 Advanced Sparse Transforms and Their Mathematical Properties\r\nVSLA’s mathematical framework naturally extends to support sophisticated tensor transfor\u0002mations that preserve the essential properties of variable-shape computation while enabling\r\ncomplex sparse manipulations.\r\nTheoretical Foundation for Sparse Transforms: The equivalence class structure of\r\nVSLA (Definition 3.1) provides a rigorous foundation for defining transforms that operate on\r\nlogical tensor dimensions rather than physical memory layouts. These transforms preserve the\r\nfundamental property that [(d, v)] ∼ [(d\r\n′\r\n, v′)] if and only if their zero-padded extensions are\r\nequal, ensuring mathematical consistency across all operations.\r\nDimension-Preserving Transforms: A class of transforms that maintain the total num\u0002ber of materialized elements while changing logical organization. These include:\r\n• Permutation Operations: Reordering tensor axes corresponds to permutations in the\r\nsymmetric group Sk acting on k-dimensional tensors. For VSLA tensors, permutations op\u0002erate primarily on shape metadata rather than dense data, achieving O(log d) complexity\r\ninstead of the O(d\r\nk\r\n) required for dense tensors.\r\n• Reshape Transformations: Converting between equivalent tensor shapes (e.g., (m ×\r\nn) ↔ (mn × 1)) while preserving element count. The mathematical constraint Q\r\ni\r\ndi = Q\r\nj\r\nd\r\n′\r\nj\r\nensures well-defined reshaping operations that maintain equivalence class member\u0002ship.\r\nSparse-Aware Data Movement: Operations that enable efficient data reorganization in\r\nsparse tensor structures:\r\n• Scatter/Gather Semantics: These operations can be formalized as sparse linear trans\u0002formations T : Tr → Ts where the transformation matrix is itself sparse and variable\u0002shape. The mathematical guarantee that T([(d, v)]) = [(d\r\n′\r\n, T v)] where T operates only on\r\nmaterialized elements ensures computational efficiency.\r\n17",

            "• Adaptive Indexing: Unlike fixed-size indexing that must account for padding, VSLA in\u0002dexing operates on semantic dimensions. This enables mathematically natural expressions\r\nlike ”extract all non-zero elements with indices satisfying predicate P” without artificial\r\nboundary conditions.\r\nLemma 8.1 (Additive Invariance under Promotion/Unpromotion). For any VSLA element\r\nv ∈ D and target dimension n ≥ vdim(v), the sum of coefficients is preserved:\r\nvdim(\r\nXv)\r\ni=1\r\nvi =\r\nXn\r\ni=1\r\npromn(v)i =\r\nvdim(\r\nXv)\r\ni=1\r\nunpromvdim(v)(promn(v))i\r\nProof. By definition, promn(v) = (v1, . . . , vvdim(v), 0, . . . , 0) where the padding zeros contribute\r\nzero to the sum. Unpromotion extracts the first vdim(v) components, recovering the original\r\ncoefficients. □\r\nConservation Properties: Many scientific simulations require conservation of physi\u0002cal quantities (mass, energy, momentum). VSLA operations preserve additive invariants by\r\nLemma 8.1: since all operations respect the zero-padding equivalence relation, the sum of co\u0002efficients within any equivalence class remains invariant. This property follows directly from\r\nthe semiring homomorphism structure of VSLA operations, mirroring conservation principles\r\nin finite volume schemes [LeVeque, 2002] and discrete conservation laws in numerical analysis.\r\nTheoretical Complexity Advantages: VSLA’s equivalence class approach operates di\u0002rectly on minimal representatives, which provides a theoretical foundation for efficient sparse\r\noperations by avoiding explicit zero storage and associated indexing overhead typical of com\u0002pressed sparse formats [Saad, 2003]. This differs from traditional sparse matrix approaches\r\n(CSR, COO) [Bulu¸c and Gilbert, 2011] and the GraphBLAS standard [Mattson et al., 2021]\r\nby embedding sparsity in the algebraic structure rather than requiring explicit sparse data\r\nformats.\r\n9 Current Implementation Status & Theoretical Performance\r\n9.1 Theoretical Performance Analysis\r\nThis section presents theoretical performance characteristics of VSLA operations based on com\u0002plexity analysis and preliminary implementation studies.

This means they lack the provable properties, optimizations, and correctness guarantees\r\ninherent to VSLA.\r\nJAX [Bradbury et al., 2020]: JAX handles variable shapes via vmap and other transfor\u0002mations, but it still requires manual padding and management of dimension-related logic from\r\nthe user. It does not provide a native abstraction for variable-dimension objects.\r\n10.2 Algebraic Approaches to Computation\r\nGraphBLAS [Davis et al., 2019]: This library provides a powerful, semiring-based approach\r\nto sparse linear algebra, primarily for graph algorithms. However, it is fundamentally based\r\non fixed-dimension matrices. VSLA can be seen as extending the semiring concept to the\r\nvariable-dimension domain.\r\n10.3 Relation to Semi-Tensor Product (STP)\r\nThe Semi-Tensor Product (STP) of matrices, introduced by Cheng [Cheng, 2001], represents\r\nthe most closely related prior art. STP was developed to generalize the conventional matrix\r\nproduct to handle dimension-mismatched matrices, and has been successfully applied to Boolean\r\nnetworks, game theory, and control systems [Cheng et al., 2011]. While both VSLA and STP\r\naddress dimension mismatch, they are fundamentally different in their motivation, mechanism,\r\nand algebraic structure.\r\n• Motivation and Philosophy: STP is product-centric, designed to generalize the matrix\r\nproduct ‘A * B‘. VSLA is object-centric, designed to define a rigorous algebra for variable\u0002dimension objects themselves, starting with the definition of an equivalence class.\r\n• Mechanism: STP handles dimension mismatch via constructive lifting, using the Kro\u0002necker product to expand matrices to a common dimension. VSLA uses abstract coercion\r\nbased on equivalence classes, operating on minimal, sparse-by-design representatives with\u0002out materializing padded forms.\r\n• Algebraic Foundation: VSLA is founded on dual semiring models from the outset\r\n(Convolution/Polynomial and Kronecker), providing two distinct algebraic toolkits. The\r\nalgebraic properties of STP are a consequence of its product definition.\r\n20",

            "• Operator Set: VSLA introduces higher-level compositional operators, such as the Stack\u0002ing Operator (S) and Windowing Operator (Ω), which have no direct equivalent in the\r\nSTP literature and are designed for building hierarchical data structures.\r\nIn summary, VSLA is not a derivative of STP but an independently developed, complemen\u0002tary algebraic system. It provides a formal foundation for the type of ragged tensor operations\r\nfound in modern ML frameworks, with a strong emphasis on sparsity and compositional, hier\u0002archical data structures.\r\n11 Gradient Support and Integration\r\n11.1 Formalization of VJPs for VSLA Operations\r\nAutomatic differentiation in VSLA requires defining custom Vector-Jacobian Products (VJPs)\r\nthat respect the variable-shape nature of the tensors. Building on established AD theory\r\n[Griewank and Walther, 2008, Pearlmutter, 1994], we extend reverse-mode differentiation to\r\nhandle shape-changing operations. For an operation f : Dn → Dm, the goal is to compute\r\nthe action of the transposed Jacobian on a cotangent vector without explicitly forming the\r\nJacobian matrix.\r\nLet y = f(x1, . . . , xn) and let ¯y be the cotangent vector (gradient) with respect to y. The\r\nVJP for each input xiis ¯xi = J\r\nT\r\ni\r\ny¯, where Jiis the Jacobian of f with respect to xi.\r\nVJP for VSLA Addition: Let y = x1 + x2. The operation involves padding to an\r\nambient shape damb = max(vdim(x1), vdim(x2)). The forward operation is y = ιd1→damb (x1) +\r\nιd2→damb (x2). The Jacobian is composed of padding and un-padding operations. The VJP is\r\ntherefore:\r\nx¯1 = unpromd1\r\n(¯y), x¯2 = unpromd2\r\n(¯y)\r\nThis corresponds to slicing the incoming gradient ¯y to match the original shapes of x1 and x2.\r\nVJP for VSLA Convolution (Model A): Let y = x1 ⊗c x2. This is equivalent to\r\npolynomial multiplication Y (z) = X1(z)X2(z). The gradients are given by convolution with\r\nthe reversed other operand:\r\nx¯1 = ¯y ⊗c rev(x2), x¯2 = rev(x1) ⊗c y¯\r\nwhere rev(x) denotes the coefficient vector in reverse order. The shapes of the resulting gradients\r\nmust be handled carefully to match the original input shapes.\r\nVJP for Stacking Operator: Let Y = Sk(x1, . . . , xk). The forward operation pads each\r\nxi to an ambient shape n and concatenates them. The VJP is the reverse operation: it unstacks\r\nthe incoming gradient Y¯ and un-pads each resulting slice to match the original input shapes.\r\nx¯i = unpromvdim(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\nwhere (Y¯ )iis the i-th slice of the gradient tensor along the stacking dimension.\r\nTheorem 11.1 (VJP Correctness for Minimal-Storage Layout). The VJP formulas above are\r\ncorrect regardless of whether tensors are stored in post-padding or minimal-representative layout.\r\nProof. The key insight is that VJP correctness depends only on the mathematical equivalence\r\nrelation, not the physical storage layout.\r\nForward Operation Independence: In VSLA, the stacking operator Sk is defined on equiva\u0002lence classes [xi\r\n] ∈ D, not on specific representatives. Whether xiis stored as a minimal vector\r\nof dimension vdim(xi) or as a post-padded vector of dimension n, the mathematical result\r\nY = Sk([x1], . . . , [xk]) is identical by definition of equivalence classes.\r\n21",

The unstack operation (Y¯ )i\r\nextracts the i-th slice, yielding a tensor of ambient shape n.\r\nUnpromotion Operation: The unpromshape(xi) operation is a projection that extracts the\r\ncomponents corresponding to the original shape. This projection is mathematically well-defined\r\nand gives the correct gradient regardless of storage:\r\n• Minimal storage case: If xi was stored as dimension shape(xi), then unpromshape(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\nextracts exactly the relevant gradient components.\r\n• Post-padding case: If xi was stored as dimension n with trailing zeros, then unpromshape(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\nstill extracts the same relevant gradient components, since the trailing components of (Y¯ )i\r\ncorrespond to derivatives with respect to padding zeros, which contribute zero to the total\r\nderivative.\r\nChain Rule Verification: For any differentiable function f(Y ), the chain rule gives:\r\n∂f\r\n∂xi\r\n=\r\n∂f\r\n∂Y\r\n∂Y\r\n∂xi\r\n= Y¯ · Ji\r\nwhere Jiis the Jacobian of Sk with respect to xi. The Jacobian Ji has the block structure\r\nJi = [padn, 0, . . . , 0] regardless of input storage layout, since mathematical padding is the same\r\noperation whether applied to minimal or pre-padded representations.\r\nTherefore, ¯xi = J\r\nT\r\ni Y¯ = unpromvdim(xi)\r\n((Y¯ )i) is correct for both storage layouts. □\r\n11.2 Framework Integration\r\nAutomatic Differentiation: VSLA operations are differentiable with custom vector-Jacobian\r\nproducts (VJPs):\r\nPyTorch Integration Example\r\nclass VSLAAdd(torch.autograd.Function):\r\n@staticmethod\r\ndef forward(ctx, x, y):\r\nctx.save_for_backward(x, y)\r\nreturn vsla_add(x, y) # automatic shape promotion\r\n@staticmethod\r\ndef backward(ctx, grad_output):\r\nx, y = ctx.saved_tensors\r\n# Gradients respect original shapes\r\ngrad_x = grad_output[:x.shape[0], :x.shape[1]]\r\ngrad_y = grad_output[:y.shape[0], :y.shape[1]]\r\nreturn grad_x, grad_y\r\n# Usage in neural networks\r\nx = VSLATensor([1, 2, 3]) # shape (3,)\r\ny = VSLATensor([4, 5, 6, 7]) # shape (4,)\r\nz = VSLAAdd.apply(x, y) # shape (4,), z = [5,7,9,7]\r\nloss = z.sum()\r\nloss.backward() # gradients flow correctly\r\nJAX Custom Call Integration: Similar integration possible via jax.custom call with\r\nXLA primitives for GPU acceleration.\r\n22",

            "12 Applications\r\nVSLA’s mathematical foundations enable transformative applications across diverse domains.\r\nThis section details practical implementations that leverage the framework’s unique capabilities\r\nfor variable-shape computation.\r\n12.1 Multi-Sensor Fusion with Stacking Operations\r\nThe stacking operator Sk : (Tr)\r\nk → Tr+1 revolutionizes heterogeneous sensor integration, par\u0002ticularly in autonomous systems requiring real-time fusion of disparate data sources.\r\nAutonomous Vehicle Sensor Fusion: Consider an autonomous vehicle integrating cam\u0002era patches (3×3×64 features), LIDAR returns (7×1×32), and radar signatures (5×2×16). Tra\u0002ditional frameworks require padding to a common shape (7×3×64), wasting 85% of memory on\r\nartificial zeros. VSLA’s S3 operator computes the ambient shape (7,3,64), applies zero-padding\r\nequivalence only during computation, and stacks into a unified 3×7×3×64 representation. The\r\nmathematical guarantee vdim(Σk(A(1), . . . , A(k))) = maxi vdim(A(i)) ensures optimal memory\r\nusage while preserving all sensor information.\r\nIoT Network Integration: In smart city applications, VSLA handles heterogeneous sen\u0002sor networks where temperature sensors report single values, air quality monitors produce 5-\r\ndimensional vectors, and traffic cameras generate variable-length feature sequences. The stack\u0002ing operator creates coherent multi-modal representations without the computational overhead\r\nof padding short sensor readings to match the longest sequence.\r\nFinancial Multi-Asset Analysis: VSLA enables fusion of different market data types:\r\nscalar prices, multi-dimensional volatility surfaces, and variable-length order book snapshots.\r\nThe framework preserves the semantic meaning of each data type while enabling unified algo\u0002rithmic processing across asset classes.\r\n12.2 Streaming Multi-Resolution Analysis\r\nWindow-stacking Ωw creates tensor pyramids for real-time processing, enabling adaptive anal\u0002ysis across multiple temporal and spatial scales.\r\nAdaptive Beamforming: In wireless communications, antenna array geometries change\r\ndynamically based on interference patterns and user mobility. A 4-level pyramid with windows\r\n(8,4,2,1) transforms raw signal samples into hierarchical features capturing patterns from mi\u0002croseconds to minutes. VSLA’s sparse representation ensures that unused frequency bands or\r\nspatial directions don’t consume computational resources.\r\nFinancial High-Frequency Trading: Market microstructure analysis requires processing\r\ntick data at variable intervals—from millisecond price updates to minute-scale volume patterns.\r\nWindow-stacking creates temporal pyramids that capture both immediate market movements\r\nand longer-term trends, enabling algorithms to adapt their trading frequency based on market\r\nvolatility.\r\nMedical Signal Processing: ECG analysis benefits from multi-resolution representations\r\nwhere heartbeat detection operates on millisecond scales while arrhythmia classification requires\r\nminute-long patterns. VSLA’s tensor pyramids naturally accommodate the variable-length R-R\r\nintervals characteristic of cardiac rhythms.\r\n12.3 Adaptive AI Architectures\r\nVSLA enables next-generation neural architectures that dynamically resize based on input com\u0002plexity, moving beyond the fixed-size limitations of current frameworks. This extends recent\r\nadvances in dynamic convolution [Wu et al., 2019] and adaptive computation [Graves, 2016] to\r\na mathematically principled variable-shape framework.\r\n23",

            "Mixture-of-Experts with Variable Specialists: In language models, specialist networks\r\ncan dynamically resize from 16 to 1024 dimensions based on input complexity. Simple tokens\r\n(articles, prepositions) engage narrow specialists, while complex technical terms activate wider\r\nnetworks. VSLA’s automatic shape promotion eliminates the need for manual padding or\r\ncomplex routing mechanisms.\r\nAdaptive Convolutional Networks: Image processing benefits from kernels that adapt\r\ntheir receptive fields based on image content. Fine-detail regions use small 3×3 filters, while\r\nhomogeneous areas employ larger 9×9 or 15×15 kernels. VSLA’s convolution semiring enables\r\nefficient computation across heterogeneous kernel sizes without the memory overhead of padding\r\nall filters to maximum size.\r\nDynamic Transformer Attention: Attention mechanisms can vary their key-value di\u0002mensions based on sequence complexity. Short, simple sequences use compact representations\r\nwhile complex, long sequences access the full parameter space. This approach maintains com\u0002putational efficiency while preserving model expressiveness where needed.\r\n12.4 Scientific Computing and Simulation\r\nVSLA’s mathematical rigor extends naturally to scientific applications requiring adaptive data\r\nstructures and efficient sparse computation.\r\nAdaptive Mesh Refinement: Finite element simulations benefit from VSLA’s ability to\r\nhandle variable-sized mesh elements without explicit padding. Regions requiring fine resolution\r\nuse dense discretizations, while homogeneous areas employ coarse meshes. The stacking operator\r\nnaturally aggregates multi-resolution solutions for global analysis.\r\nParticle-in-Cell Methods: Plasma simulations involve particles moving between variable\u0002sized grid cells. VSLA’s sparse-aware operations ensure that empty grid regions don’t consume\r\ncomputational resources, while the framework’s mathematical foundations guarantee conserva\u0002tion laws are preserved during particle migration.\r\nMulti-Physics Coupling: Complex simulations involving fluid-structure interaction, elec\u0002tromagnetic fields, and thermal effects require different discretizations for each physics domain.\r\nVSLA provides a unified mathematical framework for coupling these disparate representations\r\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency.\r\n13 Future Research Directions\r\nThe mathematical foundations and practical implementations of VSLA open several promising\r\nresearch directions that could significantly advance variable-shape computation.\r\n13.1 Theoretical Extensions\r\nCategorical Formulation: While this paper establishes VSLA’s semiring foundations, a com\u0002plete categorical treatment could provide deeper structural insights. Investigating VSLA as a\r\nsemiring-enriched category with tensor products as morphisms could reveal new optimization\r\nopportunities and enable automated reasoning about variable-shape transformations. The re\u0002lationship between the stacking operator and categorical limits deserves particular attention.\r\nTopological Considerations: VSLA operations preserve certain topological properties\r\nof data (e.g., connectivity in mesh structures, causality in time series). Formalizing these\r\npreservation guarantees through topological algebra could enable certified correctness for safety\u0002critical applications like autonomous systems and medical devices.\r\nInformation-Theoretic Analysis: The relationship between shape variability and in\u0002formation content warrants investigation. Can we establish fundamental limits on compression\r\nachievable through variable-shape representations? How does the entropy of shape distributions\r\nrelate to computational complexity?\r\n24",

            "13.2 Algorithmic Advances\r\nSub-Quadratic Tensor Operations: Current VSLA implementations achieve significant\r\npractical speedups, but theoretical complexity bounds suggest further improvements. The iso\u0002morphism between convolution semirings and polynomial rings (Theorem 4.3) enables adapta\u0002tion of advanced polynomial algorithms—Karatsuba multiplication for moderate degrees, fast\r\nmulti-point evaluation, and sparse interpolation techniques.\r\nParallel and Distributed Implementations: VSLA’s sparse-by-design memory model\r\nnaturally supports parallelization, but optimal load balancing across variable-shaped data re\u0002mains challenging. Research directions include: (1) NUMA-aware memory placement for large\u0002scale tensor operations, (2) GPU implementations leveraging sparse tensor cores, and (3) dis\u0002tributed algorithms for variable-shape data across cluster computing environments.\r\nAdaptive Algorithm Selection: Different VSLA models (convolution vs. Kronecker)\r\nexhibit varying performance characteristics depending on data properties. Machine learning\r\napproaches could automatically select optimal algorithms and parameters based on runtime\r\nshape distributions and sparsity patterns.\r\n13.3 Synergies with Semi-Tensor Product (STP)\r\nThe distinct foundations of VSLA and STP suggest powerful opportunities for synergy.\r\n• STP for Control of VSLA Systems: The extensive literature on using STP for the\r\nanalysis and control of Boolean networks and finite-state systems [Cheng et al., 2011]\r\ncould be applied to systems constructed with VSLA. For example, one could use VSLA’s\r\nstacking operator to efficiently build large, sparse state-transition matrices for complex\r\nsystems, and then use established STP-based techniques to analyze their controllability\r\nand observability.\r\n• Hybrid Algebraic Models: A unified framework could be explored where VSLA’s\r\nequivalence classes serve as the fundamental objects within an STP-like algebraic struc\u0002ture. This could potentially combine the sparse-by-design efficiency of VSLA with the\r\npowerful logical and control-theoretic tools of STP, creating a ”best-of-both-worlds” model\r\nfor complex systems analysis.\r\n13.4 Integration with Modern Computing Paradigms\r\nAdvanced Automatic Differentiation: While Section 11 demonstrates basic gradient sup\u0002port through PyTorch and JAX integration, complete VSLA-native automatic differentiation\r\npresents unique challenges. Variable-shape jacobians require dynamic graph structures where\r\ngradient tensors themselves have variable shapes. The mathematical framework must handle\r\ncases where ∂\r\n∂x f(x) changes not only in magnitude but in dimension as x varies. Research di\u0002rections include: (1) developing variable-shape chain rule implementations, (2) efficient storage\r\nand computation of sparse jacobians with dynamic sparsity patterns, and (3) backward-mode\r\nAD algorithms that can handle dimension-changing operations like the stacking operator Sk.\r\nQuantum Computing Applications: Quantum algorithms naturally operate on variable\u0002dimensional Hilbert spaces, making VSLA theoretically well-suited for quantum simulation. The\r\nequivalence class structure of VSLA mirrors the mathematical treatment of quantum states\r\nup to global phase, while the semiring operations correspond to quantum gate compositions.\r\nResearch opportunities include: (1) quantum-inspired classical algorithms using VSLA tensor\r\nnetworks for simulation of quantum many-body systems, (2) hybrid quantum-classical opti\u0002mization where classical VSLA computations guide quantum variational circuits with adaptive\r\nparameter spaces, and (3) efficient simulation of quantum error correction codes where logical\r\nqubits have dynamically varying encoding dimensions.\r\n25",

            "Edge Computing and Distributed Systems: IoT and mobile applications demand\r\ncomputational efficiency under severe resource constraints, where VSLA’s memory efficiency\r\ncould enable sophisticated algorithms on edge devices. The mathematical guarantee that oper\u0002ations preserve sparsity (Theorem 3.4) ensures predictable memory usage essential for resource\u0002constrained environments. Key research challenges include: (1) ultra-low-power implementa\u0002tions leveraging VSLA’s sparse-by-design memory model, (2) online compression techniques\r\nfor streaming variable-shape data that maintain mathematical properties, and (3) federated\r\nlearning protocols that can aggregate models with heterogeneous architectures through VSLA’s\r\nautomatic shape promotion mechanisms.\r\n13.5 Domain-Specific Applications\r\nComputational Biology: Genomic and proteomic data exhibit inherent variable-length struc\u0002tures (gene sequences, protein conformations). VSLA could revolutionize bioinformatics by\r\nenabling efficient computation on variable-length sequences without the current limitations of\r\nfixed-size representations or complex masking schemes.\r\nClimate and Environmental Modeling: Atmospheric and oceanic simulations require\r\nadaptive resolution across multiple scales. VSLA’s mathematical framework could enable seam\u0002less integration of global climate models with high-resolution regional simulations, addressing\r\none of the most challenging problems in computational earth science.\r\nFinancial Engineering: Modern financial markets generate variable-dimensional data\r\nstreams (order books of different depths, options chains with varying strike ranges). VSLA\r\ncould enable more sophisticated risk management and algorithmic trading strategies that adapt\r\nto market structure changes in real-time.\r\n14 Conclusion\r\nDimension-aware computation replaces brittle padding with algebraic rigor. VSLA unifies flex\u0002ible data shapes with efficient algorithms, promising advances across adaptive AI, signal pro\u0002cessing and beyond. By establishing a formal, object-centric algebraic system, VSLA provides\r\na principled foundation for the next generation of dynamic computational frameworks, comple\u0002menting existing approaches like STP and offering a rigorous alternative to ad-hoc engineering\r\nsolutions.\r\nAI Tools Disclosure\r\nThis research extensively utilized AI assistants from Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google),\r\nand ChatGPT (OpenAI) for theoretical development, implementation, and exposition while\r\nmaintaining human oversight of all scientific contributions.\r\nReferences\r\n[Abadi et al., 2024] Abadi, M. et al.

It’s intriguing, but I wonder if a simpler approach—using just the 50-step tensor—could produce similar results. Still, maybe the best approach is to process each resolution separately through individual models and then combine them to make a final decision. This seems like a clever way to allow each resolution to be properly considered along with all others."

A hierarchy of smaller pyramids might simulate fast reflexes, while a large pyramid could promote deeper thinking. I’d consider how multi-scale models, like CNNs or RNNs, handle time series. The stacking operator may influence memory and computational complexity, especially when stacked pyramids are compared to a single large tensor. I’ll refer to the user’s paper for theoretical details, especially Proposition 6.8 on complexity, to give a concrete answer."

Building on established AD theory\r\n[L7] [Griewank and Walther, 2008, Pearlmutter, 1994], we extend reverse-mode differentiation to\r\n[L8] handle shape-changing operations. For an operation f : Dn → Dm, the goal is to compute\r\n[L9] the action of the transposed Jacobian on a cotangent vector without explicitly forming the\r\n[L10] Jacobian matrix.\r\n[L11] Let y = f(x1, . . . , xn) and let ¯y be the cotangent vector (gradient) with respect to y. The\r\n[L12] VJP for each input xiis ¯xi = J\r\n[L13] T\r\n[L14] i\r\n[L15] y¯, where Jiis the Jacobian of f with respect to xi.\r\n[L16] VJP for VSLA Addition: Let y = x1 + x2. The operation involves padding to an\r\n[L17] ambient shape damb = max(vdim(x1), vdim(x2)). The forward operation is y = ιd1→damb (x1) +\r\n[L18] ιd2→damb (x2). The Jacobian is composed of padding and un-padding operations. The VJP is\r\n[L19] therefore:\r\n[L20] x¯1 = unpromd1\r\n[L21] (¯y), x¯2 = unpromd2\r\n[L22] (¯y)\r\n[L23] This corresponds to slicing the incoming gradient ¯y to match the original shapes of x1 and x2.\r\n[L24] VJP for VSLA Convolution (Model A): Let y = x1 ⊗c x2. This is equivalent to\r\n[L25] polynomial multiplication Y (z) = X1(z)X2(z). The gradients are given by convolution with\r\n[L26] the reversed other operand:\r\n[L27] x¯1 = ¯y ⊗c rev(x2), x¯2 = rev(x1) ⊗c y¯\r\n[L28] where rev(x) denotes the coefficient vector in reverse order. The shapes of the resulting gradients\r\n[L29] must be handled carefully to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L30] VJP for Stacking Operator: Let Y = Sk(x1, . . . , xk). The forward operation pads each\r\n[L31] xi to an ambient shape n and concatenates them. The VJP is the reverse operation: it unstacks\r\n[L32] the incoming gradient Y¯ and un-pads each resulting slice to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L33] x¯i = unpromvdim(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L34] where (Y¯ )iis the i-th slice of the gradient tensor along the stacking dimension.\r\n[L35] Theorem 11.1 (VJP Correctness for Minimal-Storage Layout). The VJP formulas above are\r\n[L36] correct regardless of whether tensors are stored in post-padding or minimal-representative layout.\r\n[L37] Proof. The key insight is that VJP correctness depends only on the mathematical equivalence\r\n[L38] relation, not the physical storage layout.\r\n[L39] Forward Operation Independence: In VSLA, the stacking operator Sk is defined on equiva\u0002lence classes [xi\r\n[L40] ] ∈ D, not on specific representatives. Whether xiis stored as a minimal vector\r\n[L41] of dimension vdim(xi) or as a post-padded vector of dimension n, the mathematical result\r\n[L42] Y = Sk([x1], . . . , [xk]) is identical by definition of equivalence classes.\n# 【6†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn1file6\nMclick Target: \"1:6\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] VSLA’s S3 operator computes the ambient shape (7,3,64), applies zero-padding\r\n[L2] equivalence only during computation, and stacks into a unified 3×7×3×64 representation.

This is equivalent to\r\n[L2] polynomial multiplication Y (z) = X1(z)X2(z). The gradients are given by convolution with\r\n[L3] the reversed other operand:\r\n[L4] x¯1 = ¯y ⊗c rev(x2), x¯2 = rev(x1) ⊗c y¯\r\n[L5] where rev(x) denotes the coefficient vector in reverse order. The shapes of the resulting gradients\r\n[L6] must be handled carefully to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L7] VJP for Stacking Operator: Let Y = Sk(x1, . . . , xk). The forward operation pads each\r\n[L8] xi to an ambient shape n and concatenates them. The VJP is the reverse operation: it unstacks\r\n[L9] the incoming gradient Y¯ and un-pads each resulting slice to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L10] x¯i = unpromvdim(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L11] where (Y¯ )iis the i-th slice of the gradient tensor along the stacking dimension.\r\n[L12] Theorem 11.1 (VJP Correctness for Minimal-Storage Layout). The VJP formulas above are\r\n[L13] correct regardless of whether tensors are stored in post-padding or minimal-representative layout.\r\n[L14] Proof. The key insight is that VJP correctness depends only on the mathematical equivalence\r\n[L15] relation, not the physical storage layout.\r\n[L16] Forward Operation Independence: In VSLA, the stacking operator Sk is defined on equiva\u0002lence classes [xi\r\n[L17] ] ∈ D, not on specific representatives. Whether xiis stored as a minimal vector\r\n[L18] of dimension vdim(xi) or as a post-padded vector of dimension n, the mathematical result\r\n[L19] Y = Sk([x1], . . . , [xk]) is identical by definition of equivalence classes.\r\n[L20] 21 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 22 / 28> Gradient Propagation: During backward pass, the gradient Y¯ has the same mathematical\r\n[L21] shape as Y regardless of how the forward inputs were stored. The unstack operation (Y¯ )i\r\n[L22] extracts the i-th slice, yielding a tensor of ambient shape n.\r\n[L23] Unpromotion Operation: The unpromshape(xi) operation is a projection that extracts the\r\n[L24] components corresponding to the original shape. This projection is mathematically well-defined\r\n[L25] and gives the correct gradient regardless of storage:\r\n[L26] • Minimal storage case: If xi was stored as dimension shape(xi), then unpromshape(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L27] extracts exactly the relevant gradient components.\r\n[L28] • Post-padding case: If xi was stored as dimension n with trailing zeros, then unpromshape(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L29] still extracts the same relevant gradient components, since the trailing components of (Y¯ )i\r\n[L30] correspond to derivatives with respect to padding zeros, which contribute zero to the total\r\n[L31] derivative.\r\n[L32] Chain Rule Verification: For any differentiable function f(Y ), the chain rule gives:\r\n[L33] ∂f\r\n[L34] ∂xi\r\n[L35] =\r\n[L36] ∂f\r\n[L37] ∂Y\r\n[L38] ∂Y\r\n[L39] ∂xi\r\n[L40] = Y¯ · Ji\r\n[L41] where Jiis the Jacobian of Sk with respect to xi. The Jacobian Ji has the block structure\r\n[L42] Ji = [padn, 0, . . . , 0] regardless of input storage layout, since mathematical padding is the same\r\n[L43] operation whether applied to minimal or pre-padded representations.\r\n[L44] Therefore, ¯xi = J\r\n[L45] T\r\n[L46] i Y¯ = unpromvdim(xi)\r\n[L47] ((Y¯ )i) is correct for both storage layouts. □\r\n[L48] 11.2 Framework Integration\r\n[L49] Automatic Differentiation: VSLA operations are differentiable with custom vector-Jacobian\r\n[L50] products (VJPs):\r\n[L51] PyTorch Integration Example\r\n[L52] class VSLAAdd(torch.autograd.\n# 【10†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn1file10\nMclick Target: \"1:10\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] . . , u1(vd2 + wd2), (16)\r\n[L2] u2(v1 + w1), . . . , ud1(vd2 + wd2)))] (17)\r\n[L3] = [(d1d2,(u ⊗K v) + (u ⊗K w))] (18)\r\n[L4] = a ⊗K b + a ⊗K c (19)\r\n[L5] Right distributivity follows similarly.\r\n[L6] Absorption by zero: 0 ⊗K a = [(0 · d, ∅)] = 0 and a ⊗K 0 = 0 by the definition of Kronecker\r\n[L7] product with the empty vector.\r\n[L8] Non-commutativity: Consider a = [(2,(1, 0))] and b = [(2,(0, 1))].

In\r\n[L14] quantum computing, the state of a multi-qubit system is described by the Kronecker product\r\n[L15] of single-qubit states, and the order of the product is significant. Similarly, in tensor network\r\n[L16] methods for simulating many-body quantum systems, such as Matrix Product States (MPS) or\r\n[L17] Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), the non-commutative nature of the Kronecker product\r\n[L18] is fundamental to capturing the entanglement structure of the system. In these domains, VSLA’s\r\n[L19] Model B provides a natural and efficient framework for representing and manipulating these\r\n[L20] non-commutative structures, especially when the constituent systems have different dimensions.\r\n[L21] Proposition 5.3. x ⊗K y = y ⊗K x iff vdim x = 1 or vdim y = 1 (i.e. one operand is scalar).\r\n[L22] Lemma 5.4 (ScalarCommutation).

So\r\n[L29] the ambient shapes are identical.\r\n[L30] The elements of L are given by (L)i,j,... = (Ski(Ai))j,... padded to shape N. The elements\r\n[L31] of R are given by (R)l,... where l indexes the concatenated list of all A tensors. There is a\r\n[L32] canonical mapping from the double index (i, j) to the single index l that preserves the order\r\n[L33] of the tensors. Since the padding is to the same ambient shape N, the resulting tensors are\r\n[L34] identical up to a reshape of the leading axes from (m, k1, . . . , km) to a single flattened axis of\r\n[L35] size K.\r\n[L36] (2) Neutral-zero absorption: Zero representatives in VSLA have the form [(d, 0)] where 0\r\n[L37] is the zero vector. In the stacked output, these contribute blocks of zeros which preserve the\r\n[L38] zero-padding equivalence relation by definition.\r\n[L39] (3) Distributivity: Given tensors A(i) and B(i) and operation ◦ ∈ {+, ⊙}, we have Sk(A(1) ◦\r\n[L40] B(1), . . .) = Sk(A(1), . . .) ◦ Sk(B(1), . . .) after promoting all operands to the common ambient\r\n[L41] shape, since ◦ operates element-wise within blocks. □\r\n[L42] Proposition 6.4 (Monoidal Category Structure). The triple (Tr, +, S) forms a strict monoidal\r\n[L43] category where S is the tensor product on objects of type “list of rank-r tensors”.\r\n[L44] Proof. A strict monoidal category consists of:\r\n[L45] 1. A category C.\r\n[L46] 2. A bifunctor ⊗ : C × C → C, called the tensor product.\r\n[L47] 3. An identity object I ∈ C.\r\n[L48] 4. The tensor product is strictly associative: (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C = A ⊗ (B ⊗ C).\r\n[L49] 5.\n# 【15†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn1file15\nMclick Target: \"1:15\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 1 / 28> Variable-Shape Linear Algebra: Mathematical Foundations and\r\n[L2] High-Performance Implementation\r\n[L3] Royce Birnbaum\r\n[L4] July 19, 2025\r\n[L5] Abstract\r\n[L6] Variable-Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA) treats dimension as intrinsic data, enabling\r\n[L7] automatic shape promotion while preserving algebraic structure. This paper formalizes\r\n[L8] VSLA through equivalence classes of finite-dimensional vectors and develops two complete\r\n[L9] semiring instantiations: convolution and Kronecker products. We introduce the stacking\r\n[L10] operator S that builds higher-rank tensors from variable-shape collections, forming ten\u0002sor pyramids for streaming applications. The mathematical foundation builds on classical\r\n[L11] polynomial ring theory and formal power series [von zur Gathen and Gerhard, 2013], while\r\n[L12] the dual semiring approach extends traditional matrix algebra [Horn and Johnson, 2012,\r\n[L13] Gondran and Minoux, 2008]. While Cheng’s Semi-Tensor Product (STP) first generalized\r\n[L14] matrix products for mismatched dimensions [Cheng, 2001], VSLA offers a distinct, com\u0002plementary approach founded on equivalence classes and dual semiring models, leading to\r\n[L15] a sparse-by-design memory model. Complexity analysis shows FFT convolution preserves\r\n[L16] O(mndmax log dmax) efficiency using established fast multiplication algorithms [Cooley and Tukey, 1965].\r\n[L17] Unlike existing ragged tensor frameworks [Abadi et al., 2024, Paszke et al., 2023, Ansel et al., 2022],\r\n[L18] VSLA provides mathematically rigorous structures with provable algebraic identities, en\u0002abling principled computation for adaptive AI architectures, sensor fusion, and scientific\r\n[L19] computing.\r\n[L20] Keywords: Variable-shape tensors, stacking operator, tensor pyramids, semiring algebra, au\u0002tomatic differentiation, high-performance computing, adaptive neural networks, sensor fusion,\r\n[L21] sparse computing, semi-tensor product\r\n[L22] MSC: 15A69, 68W30, 65F05, 16Y60\r\n[L23] 1 Context and Motivation\r\n[L24] 1.1 The Dimension Problem\r\n[L25] Traditional linear algebra fixes dimensions m, n a priori. Contemporary challenges—adaptive\r\n[L26] neural networks, multi-resolution signal analysis, dynamic meshes—demand structures whose\r\n[L27] shapes evolve in real time. This fundamental mismatch between static mathematical frameworks\r\n[L28] and dynamic computational needs creates significant barriers to progress in emerging fields.\r\n[L29] Running Example: Consider training a convolutional neural network where filter widths\r\n[L30] adapt dynamically based on input complexity. A standard 3 × 3 convolution kernel K1 =\r\n[L31] [1, −1, 2] might expand to K2 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 1] for high-resolution features. Traditional frame\u0002works require manual padding: K′\r\n[L32] 1 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 0] before operations, losing semantic informa\u0002tion and incurring unnecessary computation on artificial zeros.\r\n[L33] The core mathematical challenge lies in reconciling algebraic rigor with computational flex\u0002ibility. While prior work such as the Semi-Tensor Product (STP) of matrices [Cheng, 2001]\r\n[L34] 1 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 2 / 28> provided a powerful mechanism for multiplying dimension-mismatched matrices via Kronecker\u0002based lifting, VSLA arises from a different motivation: defining a rigorous\nVisible: 0% - 82%",

Models with separate initial levels could specialize in different tasks, like a mixture-of-experts approach. As for complexity, stacking operators scale with Theta(N) when the shapes are equal."

            "Your instinct to feed the network *several* stacked views of the same signal— one-step, a 10-step window pyramid, and a 50-step window pyramid—matches how humans (and a lot of modern ML systems) reason across multiple time-scales.\n\n---\n\n## Why three resolutions usually beat one big one\n\n| Perspective | What it captures | If you rely only on a 50-step view |\n|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **1-step**  | micro-spikes, edges, “what just happened?” | These events are still in the 50-step tensor, but they’re diluted among 49 other values—your filters or attention heads must *rediscover* them. |\n| **10-step** | local patterns, bursts, short motifs | Same risk: features are present but smeared; you need deeper or wider kernels to isolate them. |\n| **50-step** | long-horizon trends, regime changes | You *do* need this context, but it can be processed more slowly. |\n\nUsing separate branches lets each sub-model specialize: the “reflex” path (1-step) can be tiny and fast; the “deliberative” path (50-step) can be deeper and run less frequently.  \n\nThe VSLA window-stacking operator \\(W_w\\) was built for exactly this multiresolution feed: compose \\(W_{10}\\) and \\(W_{50}\\) over the same stream to create a tensor pyramid of arbitrary depth — no manual padding needed fileciteturn1file1L16-L23.  Once you have three tensors, the plain stacking operator \\(S_3\\) concatenates them along a new leading axis at **Θ(N)** cost when shapes already match, and only Θ(N + k·Δ) when zero-fill is required fileciteturn1file0L75-L81.  That’s cheap enough that you can form the multiscale batch every timestep.\n\n---\n\n## A practical architecture sketch\n\n```\n              ┌────────── fast CNN / TCN ──────────┐\nraw stream ─► S₁ ───────────────────────────────────┤\n              └──── features_f (R¹) ───────────────┘\n              ┌────────── mid-range encoder ────────┐\nW₁₀(stream) ─► S₁ ──────────────────────────────────┤\n              └──── features_m (R¹⁰) ───────────────┘\n              ┌────────── deep encoder ─────────────┐\nW₅₀(stream) ─► S₁ ──────────────────────────────────┤    concat / attention\n              └──── features_s (R⁵⁰) ───────────────┘            │\n                                                                ▼\n                                                    master aggregator\n                                                    (MLP / transformer)\n```\n\n* Branch encoders can share a lightweight stem (e.g., causal 1-D conv) and diverge after the initial layer.  \n* The aggregator can be as simple as concatenation + MLP, or as rich as cross-scale attention.  \n* Because the branches are independent, you can clock them differently: run the 1-step path every tick, the 10-step path every 5–10 ticks, and the 50-step path every 25–50 ticks—mimicking reflex vs. deliberation.\n\nVSLA’s automatic promotion keeps tensor shapes consistent, so cross-scale attention heads or gating MLPs don’t need padding logic.  Multi-resolution analysis is listed as a first-class application of the stacking machinery for exactly this reason fileciteturn1file8L1-L8.\n\n---\n\n## When a single 50-step tensor *might* suffice\n\n* **Tiny datasets / memory budgets.** One big tensor means one encoder, which can be lighter overall.  \n* **Very smooth signals.** If almost all information lives at long horizons, fine-grained views add noise.  \n* **Edge hardware without overlap-save tricks.** Even Θ(N) promotion may bottleneck if N is huge and you can’t overlap compute with I/O.\n\nYou can test this empirically: train the big-tensor model first, then swap in the multiscale model and compare validation loss vs. latency.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation tips in VSLA\n\n1. **Build windows:**  \n   ```python\n   level1 = S1(stream[t])          # shape (1, d)\n   level2 = S1(W10(stream)[-1])    # latest 10-step window\n   level3 = S1(W50(stream)[-1])    # latest 50-step window\n   multiscale = S3(level1, level2, level3)\n   ```\n2. **Gradient-safe:** custom VJPs for \\(S_k\\) already unstack and un-pad during back-prop, so autograd just works.  \n3. **Profiling:** time the two configurations; you should see the fast branch dominate steady-state latency.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n*If* you can afford three small encoders, the multiscale design usually learns faster, is more interpretable, and gives you a natural knob for “reflex vs. deep thought.”  \n*If* resources are razor-thin, start with the 50-step tensor, but keep the multiresolution upgrade on your roadmap—VSLA makes it nearly free to flip on when you need the extra nuance."

Let w ∈ N\r\n[L3] + be a fixed window length. For a\r\n[L4] stream (X(0), X(1), . . .) ⊂ Tr, define\r\n[L5] Ww\r\n[L6] \r\n[L7] X(t)\r\n[L8] \u0001\r\n[L9] s\r\n[L10] = Sw\r\n[L11] \r\n[L12] X(sw)\r\n[L13] , . . . , X(sw+w−1)\u0001\r\n[L14] ∈ Tr+1, s = 0, 1, . . .\r\n[L15] This slides a window of length w with step w (non-overlapping) and stacks the contents.\r\n[L16] Definition 6.6 (Tensor Pyramids). Compose W repeatedly with window sizes w1, w2, . . . , wd:\r\n[L17] X(0) Ww1 −−−→ Tr+1\r\n[L18] Ww2 −−−→ Tr+2 · · ·\r\n[L19] Wwd −−−→ Tr+d\r\n[L20] Each level aggregates lower-level tensors into the next rank, giving a d-level tensor pyramid.\r\n[L21] Connection to Classical Pyramids: VSLA tensor pyramids generalize classical pyramid\r\n[L22] structures from signal processing and computer vision. Like Gaussian pyramids that progres\u0002sively blur and downsample images, or Laplacian pyramids that capture multi-scale edge in\u0002formation [Burt and Adelson, 1983], tensor pyramids create hierarchical representations. The\r\n[L23] mathematical foundation extends wavelets and multiresolution analysis [Mallat, 1999] to the\r\n[L24] variable-shape setting.

This enables mathematically natural expressions\r\n[L2] like ”extract all non-zero elements with indices satisfying predicate P” without artificial\r\n[L3] boundary conditions.\r\n[L4] Lemma 8.1 (Additive Invariance under Promotion/Unpromotion).

VSLA operations preserve additive invariants by\r\n[L21] Lemma 8.1: since all operations respect the zero-padding equivalence relation, the sum of co\u0002efficients within any equivalence class remains invariant.

Contemporary challenges—adaptive\r\n[L7] neural networks, multi-resolution signal analysis, dynamic meshes—demand structures whose\r\n[L8] shapes evolve in real time. This fundamental mismatch between static mathematical frameworks\r\n[L9] and dynamic computational needs creates significant barriers to progress in emerging fields.\r\n[L10] Running Example: Consider training a convolutional neural network where filter widths\r\n[L11] adapt dynamically based on input complexity. A standard 3 × 3 convolution kernel K1 =\r\n[L12] [1, −1, 2] might expand to K2 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 1] for high-resolution features. Traditional frame\u0002works require manual padding: K′\r\n[L13] 1 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 0] before operations, losing semantic informa\u0002tion and incurring unnecessary computation on artificial zeros.\r\n[L14] The core mathematical challenge lies in reconciling algebraic rigor with computational flex\u0002ibility. While prior work such as the Semi-Tensor Product (STP) of matrices [Cheng, 2001]\r\n[L15] 1 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 2 / 28> provided a powerful mechanism for multiplying dimension-mismatched matrices via Kronecker\u0002based lifting, VSLA arises from a different motivation: defining a rigorous algebraic system for\r\n[L16] variable-dimension objects themselves. VSLA’s equivalence-class abstraction avoids materializ\u0002ing padded zeros and supplies dual semiring models oriented toward convolutional (polynomial)\r\n[L17] and Kronecker (tensor growth) behaviors.\r\n[L18] 1.2 Limitations of Current Approaches\r\n[L19] Existing frameworks fail to provide both mathematical rigor and computational flexibility:\r\n[L20] • TensorFlow Ragged Tensors: Handle variable-length sequences but lack rigorous alge\u0002braic structure and semiring properties.\r\n[L21] • PyTorch NestedTensors: Provide dynamic shapes but without mathematical guarantees\r\n[L22] or efficient sparse representations.\r\n[L23] • Manual zero-padding: Obscures mathematical structure, wastes computation, and lacks\r\n[L24] provable algebraic identities.\r\n[L25] 1.3 The VSLA Solution\r\n[L26] VSLA incorporates the shape directly into every algebraic object through mathematically rigor\u0002ous equivalence classes. Operations such as addition or convolution implicitly coerce operands\r\n[L27] to a common dimension while preserving sparsity and algebraic properties. In our example,\r\n[L28] K1 ⊕ K2 = [2, −2, 4, 0, 1] automatically, with provable semiring laws and efficient sparse com\u0002putation.\r\n[L29] Core Innovation: Rather than forcing all tensors into fixed dimensions, VSLA treats\r\n[L30] dimension as intrinsic data through equivalence classes (d, v) ∼ (d\r\n[L31] ′\r\n[L32] , v′) when their zero-padded\r\n[L33] extensions match. This enables automatic shape promotion: (3, [1, −1, 2])+ (5, [3, 0, −1, 1, 2]) =\r\n[L34] (5, [4, −1, 1, 1, 2]) without explicit padding operations.\r\n[L35] Mathematical Rigor: VSLA operations form semiring structures enabling algebraic ma\u0002nipulation while preserving computational efficiency. Two instantiations provide different com\u0002putational trade-offs: convolution semiring (O(mndmax log dmax)) and Kronecker semiring (O(mnd2\r\n[L36] max)).\n# 【7†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn2file7\nMclick Target: \"2:7\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] These measures ensure that while VSLA provides flexibility, it does not compromise the\r\n[L2] stability or security of the systems it runs on.\r\n[L3] Implementation Status: The current VSLA library provides a single-threaded CPU im\u0002plementation requiring C11 (minimum standard) for aligned memory allocation and atomic\r\n[L4] operations support.

These transforms preserve the\r\n[L4] fundamental property that [(d, v)] ∼ [(d\r\n[L5] ′\r\n[L6] , v′)] if and only if their zero-padded extensions are\r\n[L7] equal, ensuring mathematical consistency across all operations.\r\n[L8] Dimension-Preserving Transforms: A class of transforms that maintain the total num\u0002ber of materialized elements while changing logical organization. These include:\r\n[L9] • Permutation Operations: Reordering tensor axes corresponds to permutations in the\r\n[L10] symmetric group Sk acting on k-dimensional tensors. For VSLA tensors, permutations op\u0002erate primarily on shape metadata rather than dense data, achieving O(log d) complexity\r\n[L11] instead of the O(d\r\n[L12] k\r\n[L13] ) required for dense tensors.\r\n[L14] • Reshape Transformations: Converting between equivalent tensor shapes (e.g., (m ×\r\n[L15] n) ↔ (mn × 1)) while preserving element count. The mathematical constraint Q\r\n[L16] i\r\n[L17] di = Q\r\n[L18] j\r\n[L19] d\r\n[L20] ′\r\n[L21] j\r\n[L22] ensures well-defined reshaping operations that maintain equivalence class member\u0002ship.\r\n[L23] Sparse-Aware Data Movement: Operations that enable efficient data reorganization in\r\n[L24] sparse tensor structures:\r\n[L25] • Scatter/Gather Semantics: These operations can be formalized as sparse linear trans\u0002formations T : Tr → Ts where the transformation matrix is itself sparse and variable\u0002shape. The mathematical guarantee that T([(d, v)]) = [(d\r\n[L26] ′\r\n[L27] , T v)] where T operates only on\r\n[L28] materialized elements ensures computational efficiency.\r\n[L29] 17 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 28> • Adaptive Indexing: Unlike fixed-size indexing that must account for padding, VSLA in\u0002dexing operates on semantic dimensions. This enables mathematically natural expressions\r\n[L30] like ”extract all non-zero elements with indices satisfying predicate P” without artificial\r\n[L31] boundary conditions.\r\n[L32] Lemma 8.1 (Additive Invariance under Promotion/Unpromotion). For any VSLA element\r\n[L33] v ∈ D and target dimension n ≥ vdim(v), the sum of coefficients is preserved:\r\n[L34] vdim(\r\n[L35] Xv)\r\n[L36] i=1\r\n[L37] vi =\r\n[L38] Xn\r\n[L39] i=1\r\n[L40] promn(v)i =\r\n[L41] vdim(\r\n[L42] Xv)\r\n[L43] i=1\r\n[L44] unpromvdim(v)(promn(v))i\r\n[L45] Proof. By definition, promn(v) = (v1, . . . , vvdim(v), 0, . . . , 0) where the padding zeros contribute\r\n[L46] zero to the sum. Unpromotion extracts the first vdim(v) components, recovering the original\r\n[L47] coefficients. □\r\n[L48] Conservation Properties: Many scientific simulations require conservation of physi\u0002cal quantities (mass, energy, momentum). VSLA operations preserve additive invariants by\r\n[L49] Lemma 8.1: since all operations respect the zero-padding equivalence relation, the sum of co\u0002efficients within any equivalence class remains invariant. This property follows directly from\r\n[L50] the semiring homomorphism structure of VSLA operations, mirroring conservation principles\r\n[L51] in finite volume schemes [LeVeque, 2002] and discrete conservation laws in numerical analysis.\r\n[L52] Theoretical Complexity Advantages: VSLA’s equivalence class approach operates di\u0002rectly on minimal representatives, which provides a theoretical foundation for efficient sparse\r\n[L53] operations by avoiding explicit zero storage and associated indexing overhead typical of com\u0002pressed sparse formats [Saad, 2003].\n# 【10†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn2file10\nMclick Target: \"2:10\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Stack\r\n[L2] A(1)\r\n[L3] A(2)\r\n[L4] A(3)\r\n[L5] 3 × 2 × 4\r\n[L6] Result\r\n[L7] Zero-padding applied\r\n[L8] to reach ambient shape\r\n[L9] Figure 2: Stacking operator S3 applied to three variable-shape matrices.

In\r\n[L14] quantum computing, the state of a multi-qubit system is described by the Kronecker product\r\n[L15] of single-qubit states, and the order of the product is significant. Similarly, in tensor network\r\n[L16] methods for simulating many-body quantum systems, such as Matrix Product States (MPS) or\r\n[L17] Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), the non-commutative nature of the Kronecker product\r\n[L18] is fundamental to capturing the entanglement structure of the system. In these domains, VSLA’s\r\n[L19] Model B provides a natural and efficient framework for representing and manipulating these\r\n[L20] non-commutative structures, especially when the constituent systems have different dimensions.\r\n[L21] Proposition 5.3. x ⊗K y = y ⊗K x iff vdim x = 1 or vdim y = 1 (i.e. one operand is scalar).\r\n[L22] Lemma 5.4 (ScalarCommutation). If x = α 1 with α ∈ R then x ⊗K y = y ⊗K x for all y ∈ D.\r\n[L23] Proof. Both products equal α y by definition. □\r\n[L24] 6 Stacking Operator and Tensor Pyramids\r\n[L25] This section introduces a major theoretical extension to VSLA: the stacking operator S that\r\n[L26] builds higher-rank tensors from collections of lower-rank tensors, and the window-stacking op\u0002erator W for constructing tensor pyramids from streaming data.\r\n[L27] 6.1 The Stacking Operator S\r\n[L28] Definition 6.1 (Stacking Operator). For k ≥ 1, define the stacking operator\r\n[L29] Sk : (Tr)\r\n[L30] k −→ Tr+1\r\n[L31] that maps k rank-r tensors to a single rank-(r+ 1) tensor by concatenation along a fresh leading\r\n[L32] axis.\r\n[L33] 8 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 28> A(1)\r\n[L34] 2 × 3\r\n[L35] A(2)\r\n[L36] 2 × 4\r\n[L37] A(3)\r\n[L38] 2 × 2\r\n[L39] S3\r\n[L40] 1.\n# 【12†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn2file12\nMclick Target: \"2:12\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] It provides a formal foundation for the type of ragged tensor operations\r\n[L2] found in modern ML frameworks, with a strong emphasis on sparsity and compositional, hier\u0002archical data structures.\r\n[L3] 11 Gradient Support and Integration\r\n[L4] 11.1 Formalization of VJPs for VSLA Operations\r\n[L5] Automatic differentiation in VSLA requires defining custom Vector-Jacobian Products (VJPs)\r\n[L6] that respect the variable-shape nature of the tensors. Building on established AD theory\r\n[L7] [Griewank and Walther, 2008, Pearlmutter, 1994], we extend reverse-mode differentiation to\r\n[L8] handle shape-changing operations. For an operation f : Dn → Dm, the goal is to compute\r\n[L9] the action of the transposed Jacobian on a cotangent vector without explicitly forming the\r\n[L10] Jacobian matrix.\r\n[L11] Let y = f(x1, . . . , xn) and let ¯y be the cotangent vector (gradient) with respect to y. The\r\n[L12] VJP for each input xiis ¯xi = J\r\n[L13] T\r\n[L14] i\r\n[L15] y¯, where Jiis the Jacobian of f with respect to xi.\r\n[L16] VJP for VSLA Addition: Let y = x1 + x2. The operation involves padding to an\r\n[L17] ambient shape damb = max(vdim(x1), vdim(x2)). The forward operation is y = ιd1→damb (x1) +\r\n[L18] ιd2→damb (x2). The Jacobian is composed of padding and un-padding operations. The VJP is\r\n[L19] therefore:\r\n[L20] x¯1 = unpromd1\r\n[L21] (¯y), x¯2 = unpromd2\r\n[L22] (¯y)\r\n[L23] This corresponds to slicing the incoming gradient ¯y to match the original shapes of x1 and x2.\r\n[L24] VJP for VSLA Convolution (Model A): Let y = x1 ⊗c x2. This is equivalent to\r\n[L25] polynomial multiplication Y (z) = X1(z)X2(z). The gradients are given by convolution with\r\n[L26] the reversed other operand:\r\n[L27] x¯1 = ¯y ⊗c rev(x2), x¯2 = rev(x1) ⊗c y¯\r\n[L28] where rev(x) denotes the coefficient vector in reverse order. The shapes of the resulting gradients\r\n[L29] must be handled carefully to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L30] VJP for Stacking Operator: Let Y = Sk(x1, . . . , xk). The forward operation pads each\r\n[L31] xi to an ambient shape n and concatenates them. The VJP is the reverse operation: it unstacks\r\n[L32] the incoming gradient Y¯ and un-pads each resulting slice to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L33] x¯i = unpromvdim(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L34] where (Y¯ )iis the i-th slice of the gradient tensor along the stacking dimension.\r\n[L35] Theorem 11.1 (VJP Correctness for Minimal-Storage Layout). The VJP formulas above are\r\n[L36] correct regardless of whether tensors are stored in post-padding or minimal-representative layout.\r\n[L37] Proof. The key insight is that VJP correctness depends only on the mathematical equivalence\r\n[L38] relation, not the physical storage layout.\r\n[L39] Forward Operation Independence: In VSLA, the stacking operator Sk is defined on equiva\u0002lence classes [xi\r\n[L40] ] ∈ D, not on specific representatives. Whether xiis stored as a minimal vector\r\n[L41] of dimension vdim(xi) or as a post-padded vector of dimension n, the mathematical result\r\n[L42] Y = Sk([x1], . . . , [xk]) is identical by definition of equivalence classes.\n# 【13†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn2file13\nMclick Target: \"2:13\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Function):\r\n[L2] @staticmethod\r\n[L3] def forward(ctx, x, y):\r\n[L4] ctx.save_for_backward(x, y)\r\n[L5] return vsla_add(x, y) # automatic shape promotion\r\n[L6] @staticmethod\r\n[L7] def backward(ctx, grad_output):\r\n[L8] x, y = ctx.saved_tensors\r\n[L9] # Gradients respect original shapes\r\n[L10] grad_x = grad_output[:x.shape[0], :x.shape[1]]\r\n[L11] grad_y = grad_output[:y.shape[0], :y.shape[1]]\r\n[L12] return grad_x, grad_y\r\n[L13] # Usage in neural networks\r\n[L14] x = VSLATensor([1, 2, 3]) # shape (3,)\r\n[L15] y = VSLATensor([4, 5, 6, 7]) # shape (4,)\r\n[L16] z = VSLAAdd.apply(x, y) # shape (4,), z = [5,7,9,7]\r\n[L17] loss = z.sum()\r\n[L18] loss.backward() # gradients flow correctly\r\n[L19] JAX Custom Call Integration: Similar integration possible via jax.custom call with\r\n[L20] XLA primitives for GPU acceleration.\r\n[L21] 22 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 23 / 28> 12 Applications\r\n[L22] VSLA’s mathematical foundations enable transformative applications across diverse domains.\r\n[L23] This section details practical implementations that leverage the framework’s unique capabilities\r\n[L24] for variable-shape computation.\r\n[L25] 12.1 Multi-Sensor Fusion with Stacking Operations\r\n[L26] The stacking operator Sk : (Tr)\r\n[L27] k → Tr+1 revolutionizes heterogeneous sensor integration, par\u0002ticularly in autonomous systems requiring real-time fusion of disparate data sources.\r\n[L28] Autonomous Vehicle Sensor Fusion: Consider an autonomous vehicle integrating cam\u0002era patches (3×3×64 features), LIDAR returns (7×1×32), and radar signatures (5×2×16). Tra\u0002ditional frameworks require padding to a common shape (7×3×64), wasting 85% of memory on\r\n[L29] artificial zeros. VSLA’s S3 operator computes the ambient shape (7,3,64), applies zero-padding\r\n[L30] equivalence only during computation, and stacks into a unified 3×7×3×64 representation. The\r\n[L31] mathematical guarantee vdim(Σk(A(1), . . . , A(k))) = maxi vdim(A(i)) ensures optimal memory\r\n[L32] usage while preserving all sensor information.\r\n[L33] IoT Network Integration: In smart city applications, VSLA handles heterogeneous sen\u0002sor networks where temperature sensors report single values, air quality monitors produce 5-\r\n[L34] dimensional vectors, and traffic cameras generate variable-length feature sequences. The stack\u0002ing operator creates coherent multi-modal representations without the computational overhead\r\n[L35] of padding short sensor readings to match the longest sequence.\r\n[L36] Financial Multi-Asset Analysis: VSLA enables fusion of different market data types:\r\n[L37] scalar prices, multi-dimensional volatility surfaces, and variable-length order book snapshots.\r\n[L38] The framework preserves the semantic meaning of each data type while enabling unified algo\u0002rithmic processing across asset classes.\r\n[L39] 12.2 Streaming Multi-Resolution Analysis\r\n[L40] Window-stacking Ωw creates tensor pyramids for real-time processing, enabling adaptive anal\u0002ysis across multiple temporal and spatial scales.\r\n[L41] Adaptive Beamforming: In wireless communications, antenna array geometries change\r\n[L42] dynamically based on interference patterns and user mobility. A 4-level pyramid with windows\r\n[L43] (8,4,2,1) transforms raw signal samples into hierarchical features capturing patterns from mi\u0002croseconds to minutes.

Model B’s quadratic complexity in dmax reflects\r\n[L3] the fundamental cost of Kronecker product computation. While block-structured approaches\r\n[L4] could potentially reduce this complexity, the variable-shape nature of VSLA entries complicates\r\n[L5] such optimizations, as standard blocking assumptions may not hold uniformly across heteroge\u0002neous tensor elements.\r\n[L6] Parallel Implementations: VSLA’s memory model, which avoids storing explicit zeros, is\r\n[L7] highly amenable to parallelization. The sparse nature of the data means that many operations\r\n[L8] can be decomposed into independent sub-problems. For example, element-wise operations on\r\n[L9] VSLA tensors can be parallelized by distributing the non-zero blocks of data across multiple\r\n[L10] processing units. The main challenge is load balancing, as the variable shapes can lead to\r\n[L11] unevenly sized computational tasks. The explicit dimension metadata in VSLA tensors can be\r\n[L12] used to inform intelligent scheduling and data distribution strategies to mitigate this. Future\r\n[L13] work will explore implementations using OpenMP for multi-core CPUs and CUDA/ROCm for\r\n[L14] GPUs, focusing on sparse data structures and asynchronous memory transfers to hide latency.\r\n[L15] 8 Advanced Operations for Sparse Simulation\r\n[L16] Beyond the foundational semiring operations, the VSLA framework is particularly well-suited\r\n[L17] for advanced simulations, especially those involving sparse or dynamically changing data. This\r\n[L18] section explores how VSLA’s design principles can be extended to support complex data trans\u0002forms and movements within tensors, which are critical for such simulations.\r\n[L19] 8.1 VSLA for Enhanced Sparse Computation in Simulations\r\n[L20] VSLA’s fundamental design principles — treating dimension as intrinsic data and employing\r\n[L21] zero-padding equivalence — inherently enable superior sparse computation in simulations com\u000216 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 28> pared to traditional fixed-dimension approaches (see Section 3).\r\n[L22] • Implicit Sparsity Handling: Unlike existing frameworks that necessitate manual padding,\r\n[L23] VSLA operations (e.g., addition, convolution) automatically coerce operands to compati\u0002ble shapes while rigorously preserving sparsity. This means that implicit trailing zeros are\r\n[L24] never materialized or explicitly computed, leading to significant computational savings.\r\n[L25] • Memory Efficiency for Sparse Data: VSLA tensors store only the ”minimal represen\u0002tative” of each equivalence class, effectively avoiding the storage of explicit trailing zeros,\r\n[L26] as described in our memory model (Section 7.2). For a tensor with a large logical shape\r\n[L27] but sparse data, the storage complexity is bounded by the sum of minimal representatives\r\n[L28] rather than the ambient shape.\r\n[L29] • Optimized Algorithms: The formalization of VSLA with semiring structures allows for\r\n[L30] the development of tailored, efficient algorithms. For instance, FFT-accelerated convolu\u0002tion in Model A maintains O(mndmax log dmax) efficiency even with heterogeneous shapes\r\n[L31] (Theorem 6.12), demonstrating a concrete advantage over naive O(mnd2\r\n[L32] max) approaches\r\n[L33] for sparse convolution-heavy simulations.\r\n[L34] This intrinsic efficiency makes VSLA particularly well-suited for diverse simulation scenarios\r\n[L35] where data often exhibits dynamic shapes or high sparsity, such as adaptive mesh refinement,\r\n[L36] agent-based models, or particle simulations where elements might appear or disappear.\r\n[L37] 8.2 Advanced Sparse Transforms and Their Mathematical Properties\r\n[L38] VSLA’s mathematical framework naturally extends to support sophisticated tensor transfor\u0002mations that preserve the essential properties of variable-shape computation while enabling\r\n[L39] complex sparse manipulations.\n# 【15†vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf†file-WWWPR66i633JndFaCcE9sG】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: vsla_paper_v0.49.pdf\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn2file15\nMclick Target: \"2:15\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] 13.4 Integration with Modern Computing Paradigms\r\n[L2] Advanced Automatic Differentiation: While Section 11 demonstrates basic gradient sup\u0002port through PyTorch and JAX integration, complete VSLA-native automatic differentiation\r\n[L3] presents unique challenges. Variable-shape jacobians require dynamic graph structures where\r\n[L4] gradient tensors themselves have variable shapes. The mathematical framework must handle\r\n[L5] cases where ∂\r\n[L6] ∂x f(x) changes not only in magnitude but in dimension as x varies. Research di\u0002rections include: (1) developing variable-shape chain rule implementations, (2) efficient storage\r\n[L7] and computation of sparse jacobians with dynamic sparsity patterns, and (3) backward-mode\r\n[L8] AD algorithms that can handle dimension-changing operations like the stacking operator Sk.\r\n[L9] Quantum Computing Applications: Quantum algorithms naturally operate on variable\u0002dimensional Hilbert spaces, making VSLA theoretically well-suited for quantum simulation. The\r\n[L10] equivalence class structure of VSLA mirrors the mathematical treatment of quantum states\r\n[L11] up to global phase, while the semiring operations correspond to quantum gate compositions.\r\n[L12] Research opportunities include: (1) quantum-inspired classical algorithms using VSLA tensor\r\n[L13] networks for simulation of quantum many-body systems, (2) hybrid quantum-classical opti\u0002mization where classical VSLA computations guide quantum variational circuits with adaptive\r\n[L14] parameter spaces, and (3) efficient simulation of quantum error correction codes where logical\r\n[L15] qubits have dynamically varying encoding dimensions.\r\n[L16] 25 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 26 / 28> Edge Computing and Distributed Systems: IoT and mobile applications demand\r\n[L17] computational efficiency under severe resource constraints, where VSLA’s memory efficiency\r\n[L18] could enable sophisticated algorithms on edge devices. The mathematical guarantee that oper\u0002ations preserve sparsity (Theorem 3.4) ensures predictable memory usage essential for resource\u0002constrained environments. Key research challenges include: (1) ultra-low-power implementa\u0002tions leveraging VSLA’s sparse-by-design memory model, (2) online compression techniques\r\n[L19] for streaming variable-shape data that maintain mathematical properties, and (3) federated\r\n[L20] learning protocols that can aggregate models with heterogeneous architectures through VSLA’s\r\n[L21] automatic shape promotion mechanisms.\r\n[L22] 13.5 Domain-Specific Applications\r\n[L23] Computational Biology: Genomic and proteomic data exhibit inherent variable-length struc\u0002tures (gene sequences, protein conformations). VSLA could revolutionize bioinformatics by\r\n[L24] enabling efficient computation on variable-length sequences without the current limitations of\r\n[L25] fixed-size representations or complex masking schemes.\r\n[L26] Climate and Environmental Modeling: Atmospheric and oceanic simulations require\r\n[L27] adaptive resolution across multiple scales. VSLA’s mathematical framework could enable seam\u0002less integration of global climate models with high-resolution regional simulations, addressing\r\n[L28] one of the most challenging problems in computational earth science.\r\n[L29] Financial Engineering: Modern financial markets generate variable-dimensional data\r\n[L30] streams (order books of different depths, options chains with varying strike ranges). VSLA\r\n[L31] could enable more sophisticated risk management and algorithmic trading strategies that adapt\r\n[L32] to market structure changes in real-time.\r\n[L33] 14 Conclusion\r\n[L34] Dimension-aware computation replaces brittle padding with algebraic rigor. VSLA unifies flex\u0002ible data shapes with efficient algorithms, promising advances across adaptive AI, signal pro\u0002cessing and beyond. By establishing a formal, object-centric algebraic system, VSLA provides\r\n[L35] a principled foundation for the next generation of dynamic computational frameworks, comple\u0002menting existing approaches like STP and offering a rigorous alternative to ad-hoc engineering\r\n[L36] solutions.\r\n[L37] AI Tools Disclosure\r\n[L38] This research extensively utilized AI assistants from Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google),\r\n[L39] and ChatGPT (OpenAI) for theoretical development, implementation, and exposition while\r\n[L40] maintaining human oversight of all scientific contributions.\r\n[L41] References\r\n[L42] [Abadi et al., 2024] Abadi, M. et al.

            "[L2] Variable-Shape Linear Algebra: Mathematical Foundations and\r\n[L3] High-Performance Implementation\r\n[L4] Royce Birnbaum\r\n[L5] July 19, 2025\r\n[L6] Abstract\r\n[L7] Variable-Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA) treats dimension as intrinsic data, enabling\r\n[L8] automatic shape promotion while preserving algebraic structure. This paper formalizes\r\n[L9] VSLA through equivalence classes of finite-dimensional vectors and develops two complete\r\n[L10] semiring instantiations: convolution and Kronecker products. We introduce the stacking\r\n[L11] operator S that builds higher-rank tensors from variable-shape collections, forming ten\u0002sor pyramids for streaming applications. The mathematical foundation builds on classical\r\n[L12] polynomial ring theory and formal power series [von zur Gathen and Gerhard, 2013], while\r\n[L13] the dual semiring approach extends traditional matrix algebra [Horn and Johnson, 2012,\r\n[L14] Gondran and Minoux, 2008]. While Cheng’s Semi-Tensor Product (STP) first generalized\r\n[L15] matrix products for mismatched dimensions [Cheng, 2001], VSLA offers a distinct, com\u0002plementary approach founded on equivalence classes and dual semiring models, leading to\r\n[L16] a sparse-by-design memory model. Complexity analysis shows FFT convolution preserves\r\n[L17] O(mndmax log dmax) efficiency using established fast multiplication algorithms [Cooley and Tukey, 1965].\r\n[L18] Unlike existing ragged tensor frameworks [Abadi et al., 2024, Paszke et al., 2023, Ansel et al., 2022],\r\n[L19] VSLA provides mathematically rigorous structures with provable algebraic identities, en\u0002abling principled computation for adaptive AI architectures, sensor fusion, and scientific\r\n[L20] computing.\r\n[L21] Keywords: Variable-shape tensors, stacking operator, tensor pyramids, semiring algebra, au\u0002tomatic differentiation, high-performance computing, adaptive neural networks, sensor fusion,\r\n[L22] sparse computing, semi-tensor product\r\n[L23] MSC: 15A69, 68W30, 65F05, 16Y60\r\n[L24] 1 Context and Motivation\r\n[L25] 1.1 The Dimension Problem\r\n[L26] Traditional linear algebra fixes dimensions m, n a priori. Contemporary challenges—adaptive\r\n[L27] neural networks, multi-resolution signal analysis, dynamic meshes—demand structures whose\r\n[L28] shapes evolve in real time. This fundamental mismatch between static mathematical frameworks\r\n[L29] and dynamic computational needs creates significant barriers to progress in emerging fields.\r\n[L30] Running Example: Consider training a convolutional neural network where filter widths\r\n[L31] adapt dynamically based on input complexity. A standard 3 × 3 convolution kernel K1 =\r\n[L32] [1, −1, 2] might expand to K2 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 1] for high-resolution features. Traditional frame\u0002works require manual padding: K′\r\n[L33] 1 = [1, −1, 2, 0, 0] before operations, losing semantic informa\u0002tion and incurring unnecessary computation on artificial zeros.\r\n[L34] The core mathematical challenge lies in reconciling algebraic rigor with computational flex\u0002ibility. While prior work such as the Semi-Tensor Product (STP) of matrices [Cheng, 2001]\r\n[L35] 1",

            "[L37] provided a powerful mechanism for multiplying dimension-mismatched matrices via Kronecker\u0002based lifting, VSLA arises from a different motivation: defining a rigorous algebraic system for\r\n[L38] variable-dimension objects themselves. VSLA’s equivalence-class abstraction avoids materializ\u0002ing padded zeros and supplies dual semiring models oriented toward convolutional (polynomial)\r\n[L39] and Kronecker (tensor growth) behaviors.\r\n[L40] 1.2 Limitations of Current Approaches\r\n[L41] Existing frameworks fail to provide both mathematical rigor and computational flexibility:\r\n[L42] • TensorFlow Ragged Tensors: Handle variable-length sequences but lack rigorous alge\u0002braic structure and semiring properties.\r\n[L43] • PyTorch NestedTensors: Provide dynamic shapes but without mathematical guarantees\r\n[L44] or efficient sparse representations.\r\n[L45] • Manual zero-padding: Obscures mathematical structure, wastes computation, and lacks\r\n[L46] provable algebraic identities.\r\n[L47] 1.3 The VSLA Solution\r\n[L48] VSLA incorporates the shape directly into every algebraic object through mathematically rigor\u0002ous equivalence classes. Operations such as addition or convolution implicitly coerce operands\r\n[L49] to a common dimension while preserving sparsity and algebraic properties. In our example,\r\n[L50] K1 ⊕ K2 = [2, −2, 4, 0, 1] automatically, with provable semiring laws and efficient sparse com\u0002putation.\r\n[L51] Core Innovation: Rather than forcing all tensors into fixed dimensions, VSLA treats\r\n[L52] dimension as intrinsic data through equivalence classes (d, v) ∼ (d\r\n[L53] ′\r\n[L54] , v′) when their zero-padded\r\n[L55] extensions match. This enables automatic shape promotion: (3, [1, −1, 2])+ (5, [3, 0, −1, 1, 2]) =\r\n[L56] (5, [4, −1, 1, 1, 2]) without explicit padding operations.\r\n[L57] Mathematical Rigor: VSLA operations form semiring structures enabling algebraic ma\u0002nipulation while preserving computational efficiency. Two instantiations provide different com\u0002putational trade-offs: convolution semiring (O(mndmax log dmax)) and Kronecker semiring (O(mnd2\r\n[L58] max)).\r\n[L59] Practical Impact: Variable-shape computation eliminates memory waste from artificial\r\n[L60] padding, enables adaptive neural architectures, and provides mathematical foundations for\r\n[L61] emerging applications in multi-sensor fusion, quantum simulation, and edge computing.\r\n[L62] 1.4 Roadmap\r\n[L63] This paper proceeds as follows: §2 establishes mathematical preliminaries; §3–§5 develop two\r\n[L64] semiring models with complete proofs; §6 introduces the stacking operator and tensor pyra\u0002mid constructions; §6.4–§7 bridge theory to implementation; §8 extends to advanced sparse\r\n[L65] simulation operations; §9–§10 provide empirical validation and context.\r\n[L66] 2",

A ring R is graded if it can be written as a direct sum\r\n[L313] R =\r\n[L314] L\r\n[L315] n≥0 Rn such that RmRn ⊆ Rm+n. For R[x], the graded components are the subspaces\r\n[L316] of homogeneous polynomials of degree n, i.e., Rn = span(x\r\n[L317] n\r\n[L318] ). The VSLA ”degree” corresponds\r\n[L319] directly to the polynomial degree, and the convolution operation corresponds to polynomial\r\n[L320] multiplication, which respects the grading.\r\n[L321] Rees Algebra: The Rees algebra (or blow-up algebra) associated with an ideal I of a ring\r\n[L322] R is defined as R(I) = L\r\n[L323] n≥0\r\n[L324] I\r\n[L325] n\r\n[L326] t\r\n[L327] n ⊆ R[t]. While not a direct equivalent, the VSLA framework\r\n[L328] shares the spirit of the Rees algebra by tracking ”powers” of some fundamental structure. In\r\n[L329] VSLA, the ”ideal” can be thought of as the space of all possible vector extensions, and the\r\n[L330] ”degree” of a VSLA element tracks how ”large” an extension is needed. The key difference is\r\n[L331] that VSLA is built on a semiring and focuses on computational aspects of variable-length data,\r\n[L332] whereas the Rees algebra is a tool in commutative algebra for studying the structure of ideals.\r\n[L333] By framing VSLA in this context, we see that it is not an ad-hoc construction but rather a\r\n[L334] computationally-oriented realization of well-understood algebraic objects, tailored to the specific\r\n[L335] challenges of variable-shape data in high-performance computing.\r\n[L336] Theorem 4.4 (Completion). Equip D with the norm ∥[(d, v)]∥1 := Pd\r\n[L337] i=1 |vi\r\n[L338] |. The Cauchy\r\n[L339] completion of (D, ∥·∥1) is isometrically isomorphic to the Banach space ℓ\r\n[L340] 1\r\n[L341] (N0) of absolutely\r\n[L342] summable sequences, which is a subspace of the formal power series ring R[[x]]. This extends\r\n[L343] classical results on polynomial ring completions [Rudin, 1991, von zur Gathen and Gerhard, 2013]\r\n[L344] to the variable-dimension setting.\r\n[L345] Proof. We provide a complete proof with topological clarification.\r\n[L346] 1. The Normed Space: The map ∥·∥1 : D → R≥0 is a well-defined norm. The isomorphism\r\n[L347] Φ : D → R[x] from Theorem 4.3 allows us to view D as the space of polynomials. For a\r\n[L348] polynomial p(x) = Pd−1\r\n[L349] i=0 aix\r\n[L350] i\r\n[L351] , the norm is ∥p∥1 =\r\n[L352] Pd−1\r\n[L353] i=0 |ai\r\n[L354] |.

For any ϵ > 0, there exists N such that\r\n[L362] for n, m > N, ∥pn − pm∥1 < ϵ. Let pn(x) = Pvdim(pn)\r\n[L363] i=0 an,ix\r\n[L364] i\r\n[L365] . The norm condition implies that\r\n[L366] for each fixed coefficient index i, the sequence of real numbers (an,i)n∈N is a Cauchy sequence\r\n[L367] in R. This is because |an,i − am,i| ≤ P\r\n[L368] j\r\n[L369] |an,j − am,j | = ∥pn − pm∥1 < ϵ.\r\n[L370] 3. The Limit Object: Since R is complete, each sequence (an,i)n converges to a limit ai ∈ R.\r\n[L371] We define the limit object in the completion as the formal power series p(x) = P∞\r\n[L372] i=0 aix\r\n[L373] i\r\n[L374] .\r\n[L375] 4. The Completion Space: We must show that this limit object p(x) is in the space ℓ\r\n[L376] 1\r\n[L377] (N0),\r\n[L378] i.e., P∞\r\n[L379] i=0 |ai\r\n[L380] | < ∞. Since (pn) n is a Cauchy sequence, it is bounded: there exists M > 0 such\r\n[L381] that ∥pn∥1 ≤ M for all n. For any finite K,\r\n[L382] PK\r\n[L383] i=0 |an,i| ≤ M. Taking the limit as n → ∞, we\r\n[L384] get PK\r\n[L385] i=0 |ai\r\n[L386] | ≤ M.

In\r\n[L456] quantum computing, the state of a multi-qubit system is described by the Kronecker product\r\n[L457] of single-qubit states, and the order of the product is significant. Similarly, in tensor network\r\n[L458] methods for simulating many-body quantum systems, such as Matrix Product States (MPS) or\r\n[L459] Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), the non-commutative nature of the Kronecker product\r\n[L460] is fundamental to capturing the entanglement structure of the system. In these domains, VSLA’s\r\n[L461] Model B provides a natural and efficient framework for representing and manipulating these\r\n[L462] non-commutative structures, especially when the constituent systems have different dimensions.\r\n[L463] Proposition 5.3. x ⊗K y = y ⊗K x iff vdim x = 1 or vdim y = 1 (i.e. one operand is scalar).\r\n[L464] Lemma 5.4 (ScalarCommutation).

The identity object is a strict identity for the tensor product: I ⊗ A = A and A ⊗ I = A.\r\n[L616] We define a category CV SLA where:\r\n[L617] • Objects: Finite lists of rank-r VSLA tensors, i.e., elements of (Tr)\r\n[L618] k\r\n[L619] for any k ≥ 0. An\r\n[L620] object is denoted A = (A1, . . . , Ak).\r\n[L621] • Morphisms: Identity maps (we focus on the categorical structure of objects and tensor\r\n[L622] product).\r\n[L623] The monoidal product ⊗ is list concatenation:\r\n[L624] A ⊗ B = (A1, . . . , Ak) ⊗ (B1, . . . , Bm) := (A1, . . . , Ak, B1, . . . , Bm).\r\n[L625] The identity object I is the empty list () ∈ (Tr)\r\n[L626] 0\r\n[L627] .\r\n[L628] Verification of strict monoidal axioms:\r\n[L629] 10",

            "[L631] • Associativity: List concatenation is strictly associative. For lists A, B, and C, both\r\n[L632] (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C and A ⊗ (B ⊗ C) yield the same concatenated list.\r\n[L633] • Identity Laws: The empty list acts as strict identity: I ⊗ A = () ⊗ A = A and\r\n[L634] A ⊗ I = A ⊗ () = A.\r\n[L635] Thus (CV SLA, ⊗, I) is a strict monoidal category. The stacking operator S acts as a functor\r\n[L636] from this category to single VSLA tensors, with the property Sm(Sk(A), Sk(B)) ∼= Smk(A, B)\r\n[L637] demonstrating compositional structure. □\r\n[L638] Practical Interpretation: The strict monoidal category structure guarantees that stack\u0002ing operations compose predictably and associatively. This means that S2(S2(A, B), C) =\r\n[L639] S3(A, B, C) up to canonical isomorphism, enabling reliable nested tensor constructions in stream\u0002ing applications and recursive data structures.\r\n[L640] 6.2 Window-Stacking and Tensor Pyramids\r\n[L641] Definition 6.5 (Window-Stacking Operator).

Like Gaussian pyramids that progres\u0002sively blur and downsample images, or Laplacian pyramids that capture multi-scale edge in\u0002formation [Burt and Adelson, 1983], tensor pyramids create hierarchical representations. The\r\n[L662] mathematical foundation extends wavelets and multiresolution analysis [Mallat, 1999] to the\r\n[L663] variable-shape setting. However, unlike these fixed-resolution approaches, VSLA tensor pyra\u0002mids handle variable-shape data at each level through the zero-padding equivalence relation,\r\n[L664] enabling adaptive multi-resolution processing without predetermined scale factors or uniform\r\n[L665] downsampling ratios.\r\n[L666] Example 6.7 (Signal Processing Pyramid).

            "[L893] 7.3 Security Considerations\r\n[L894] VSLA’s dynamic nature introduces security considerations, primarily related to resource man\u0002agement and data validation. Maliciously crafted inputs with extremely large or pathological\r\n[L895] shape metadata could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by triggering excessive memory\r\n[L896] allocation or computation.\r\n[L897] To mitigate these risks, the VSLA C-library implementation includes several safeguards:\r\n[L898] • Shape Validation: All input tensors have their shape metadata rigorously validated.\r\n[L899] This includes checks for excessive dimension sizes, and rank mismatches. The library\r\n[L900] imposes a configurable maximum on the total number of elements to prevent pathological\r\n[L901] memory allocation.\r\n[L902] • Resource Limiting: The API allows callers to specify resource limits, such as a max\u0002imum memory footprint for any single operation. This prevents a single user or process\r\n[L903] from exhausting system resources.\r\n[L904] • Integer Overflow Protection: All internal arithmetic for calculating memory offsets\r\n[L905] and sizes is checked for integer overflows, a common source of vulnerabilities in C/C++\r\n[L906] code.\r\n[L907] These measures ensure that while VSLA provides flexibility, it does not compromise the\r\n[L908] stability or security of the systems it runs on.\r\n[L909] Implementation Status: The current VSLA library provides a single-threaded CPU im\u0002plementation requiring C11 (minimum standard) for aligned memory allocation and atomic\r\n[L910] operations support.

FFT-based convolu\u0002tion [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] achieves O(dmax log dmax) per-element complexity, while Karat\u0002suba multiplication [Karatsuba and Ofman, 1962] and more sophisticated approaches [Cantor and Kaltofen, 199\r\n[L975] offer alternative trade-offs for moderate degrees. Model B’s quadratic complexity in dmax reflects\r\n[L976] the fundamental cost of Kronecker product computation. While block-structured approaches\r\n[L977] could potentially reduce this complexity, the variable-shape nature of VSLA entries complicates\r\n[L978] such optimizations, as standard blocking assumptions may not hold uniformly across heteroge\u0002neous tensor elements.\r\n[L979] Parallel Implementations: VSLA’s memory model, which avoids storing explicit zeros, is\r\n[L980] highly amenable to parallelization. The sparse nature of the data means that many operations\r\n[L981] can be decomposed into independent sub-problems. For example, element-wise operations on\r\n[L982] VSLA tensors can be parallelized by distributing the non-zero blocks of data across multiple\r\n[L983] processing units. The main challenge is load balancing, as the variable shapes can lead to\r\n[L984] unevenly sized computational tasks. The explicit dimension metadata in VSLA tensors can be\r\n[L985] used to inform intelligent scheduling and data distribution strategies to mitigate this. Future\r\n[L986] work will explore implementations using OpenMP for multi-core CPUs and CUDA/ROCm for\r\n[L987] GPUs, focusing on sparse data structures and asynchronous memory transfers to hide latency.\r\n[L988] 8 Advanced Operations for Sparse Simulation\r\n[L989] Beyond the foundational semiring operations, the VSLA framework is particularly well-suited\r\n[L990] for advanced simulations, especially those involving sparse or dynamically changing data. This\r\n[L991] section explores how VSLA’s design principles can be extended to support complex data trans\u0002forms and movements within tensors, which are critical for such simulations.\r\n[L992] 8.1 VSLA for Enhanced Sparse Computation in Simulations\r\n[L993] VSLA’s fundamental design principles — treating dimension as intrinsic data and employing\r\n[L994] zero-padding equivalence — inherently enable superior sparse computation in simulations com\u000216",

            "[L996] pared to traditional fixed-dimension approaches (see Section 3).\r\n[L997] • Implicit Sparsity Handling: Unlike existing frameworks that necessitate manual padding,\r\n[L998] VSLA operations (e.g., addition, convolution) automatically coerce operands to compati\u0002ble shapes while rigorously preserving sparsity. This means that implicit trailing zeros are\r\n[L999] never materialized or explicitly computed, leading to significant computational savings.\r\n[L1000] • Memory Efficiency for Sparse Data: VSLA tensors store only the ”minimal represen\u0002tative” of each equivalence class, effectively avoiding the storage of explicit trailing zeros,\r\n[L1001] as described in our memory model (Section 7.2). For a tensor with a large logical shape\r\n[L1002] but sparse data, the storage complexity is bounded by the sum of minimal representatives\r\n[L1003] rather than the ambient shape.\r\n[L1004] • Optimized Algorithms: The formalization of VSLA with semiring structures allows for\r\n[L1005] the development of tailored, efficient algorithms. For instance, FFT-accelerated convolu\u0002tion in Model A maintains O(mndmax log dmax) efficiency even with heterogeneous shapes\r\n[L1006] (Theorem 6.12), demonstrating a concrete advantage over naive O(mnd2\r\n[L1007] max) approaches\r\n[L1008] for sparse convolution-heavy simulations.\r\n[L1009] This intrinsic efficiency makes VSLA particularly well-suited for diverse simulation scenarios\r\n[L1010] where data often exhibits dynamic shapes or high sparsity, such as adaptive mesh refinement,\r\n[L1011] agent-based models, or particle simulations where elements might appear or disappear.\r\n[L1012] 8.2 Advanced Sparse Transforms and Their Mathematical Properties\r\n[L1013] VSLA’s mathematical framework naturally extends to support sophisticated tensor transfor\u0002mations that preserve the essential properties of variable-shape computation while enabling\r\n[L1014] complex sparse manipulations.\r\n[L1015] Theoretical Foundation for Sparse Transforms: The equivalence class structure of\r\n[L1016] VSLA (Definition 3.1) provides a rigorous foundation for defining transforms that operate on\r\n[L1017] logical tensor dimensions rather than physical memory layouts. These transforms preserve the\r\n[L1018] fundamental property that [(d, v)] ∼ [(d\r\n[L1019] ′\r\n[L1020] , v′)] if and only if their zero-padded extensions are\r\n[L1021] equal, ensuring mathematical consistency across all operations.\r\n[L1022] Dimension-Preserving Transforms: A class of transforms that maintain the total num\u0002ber of materialized elements while changing logical organization. These include:\r\n[L1023] • Permutation Operations: Reordering tensor axes corresponds to permutations in the\r\n[L1024] symmetric group Sk acting on k-dimensional tensors. For VSLA tensors, permutations op\u0002erate primarily on shape metadata rather than dense data, achieving O(log d) complexity\r\n[L1025] instead of the O(d\r\n[L1026] k\r\n[L1027] ) required for dense tensors.\r\n[L1028] • Reshape Transformations: Converting between equivalent tensor shapes (e.g., (m ×\r\n[L1029] n) ↔ (mn × 1)) while preserving element count. The mathematical constraint Q\r\n[L1030] i\r\n[L1031] di = Q\r\n[L1032] j\r\n[L1033] d\r\n[L1034] ′\r\n[L1035] j\r\n[L1036] ensures well-defined reshaping operations that maintain equivalence class member\u0002ship.\r\n[L1037] Sparse-Aware Data Movement: Operations that enable efficient data reorganization in\r\n[L1038] sparse tensor structures:\r\n[L1039] • Scatter/Gather Semantics: These operations can be formalized as sparse linear trans\u0002formations T : Tr → Ts where the transformation matrix is itself sparse and variable\u0002shape. The mathematical guarantee that T([(d, v)]) = [(d\r\n[L1040] ′\r\n[L1041] , T v)] where T operates only on\r\n[L1042] materialized elements ensures computational efficiency.\r\n[L1043] 17",

            "[L1045] • Adaptive Indexing: Unlike fixed-size indexing that must account for padding, VSLA in\u0002dexing operates on semantic dimensions. This enables mathematically natural expressions\r\n[L1046] like ”extract all non-zero elements with indices satisfying predicate P” without artificial\r\n[L1047] boundary conditions.\r\n[L1048] Lemma 8.1 (Additive Invariance under Promotion/Unpromotion). For any VSLA element\r\n[L1049] v ∈ D and target dimension n ≥ vdim(v), the sum of coefficients is preserved:\r\n[L1050] vdim(\r\n[L1051] Xv)\r\n[L1052] i=1\r\n[L1053] vi =\r\n[L1054] Xn\r\n[L1055] i=1\r\n[L1056] promn(v)i =\r\n[L1057] vdim(\r\n[L1058] Xv)\r\n[L1059] i=1\r\n[L1060] unpromvdim(v)(promn(v))i\r\n[L1061] Proof. By definition, promn(v) = (v1, . . . , vvdim(v), 0, . . . , 0) where the padding zeros contribute\r\n[L1062] zero to the sum. Unpromotion extracts the first vdim(v) components, recovering the original\r\n[L1063] coefficients. □\r\n[L1064] Conservation Properties: Many scientific simulations require conservation of physi\u0002cal quantities (mass, energy, momentum). VSLA operations preserve additive invariants by\r\n[L1065] Lemma 8.1: since all operations respect the zero-padding equivalence relation, the sum of co\u0002efficients within any equivalence class remains invariant. This property follows directly from\r\n[L1066] the semiring homomorphism structure of VSLA operations, mirroring conservation principles\r\n[L1067] in finite volume schemes [LeVeque, 2002] and discrete conservation laws in numerical analysis.\r\n[L1068] Theoretical Complexity Advantages: VSLA’s equivalence class approach operates di\u0002rectly on minimal representatives, which provides a theoretical foundation for efficient sparse\r\n[L1069] operations by avoiding explicit zero storage and associated indexing overhead typical of com\u0002pressed sparse formats [Saad, 2003]. This differs from traditional sparse matrix approaches\r\n[L1070] (CSR, COO) [Bulu¸c and Gilbert, 2011] and the GraphBLAS standard [Mattson et al., 2021]\r\n[L1071] by embedding sparsity in the algebraic structure rather than requiring explicit sparse data\r\n[L1072] formats.\r\n[L1073] 9 Current Implementation Status & Theoretical Performance\r\n[L1074] 9.1 Theoretical Performance Analysis\r\n[L1075] This section presents theoretical performance characteristics of VSLA operations based on com\u0002plexity analysis and preliminary implementation studies.

They use data\r\n[L1138] structures like value rowids or nested buffers to store variable-length sequences. While effec\u0002tive for specific tasks like NLP batching, they are not a formal algebraic system. Operations are\r\n[L1139] defined as library functions, not as instances of a coherent mathematical structure like a semir\u0002ing. This means they lack the provable properties, optimizations, and correctness guarantees\r\n[L1140] inherent to VSLA.\r\n[L1141] JAX [Bradbury et al., 2020]: JAX handles variable shapes via vmap and other transfor\u0002mations, but it still requires manual padding and management of dimension-related logic from\r\n[L1142] the user. It does not provide a native abstraction for variable-dimension objects.\r\n[L1143] 10.2 Algebraic Approaches to Computation\r\n[L1144] GraphBLAS [Davis et al., 2019]: This library provides a powerful, semiring-based approach\r\n[L1145] to sparse linear algebra, primarily for graph algorithms. However, it is fundamentally based\r\n[L1146] on fixed-dimension matrices. VSLA can be seen as extending the semiring concept to the\r\n[L1147] variable-dimension domain.\r\n[L1148] 10.3 Relation to Semi-Tensor Product (STP)\r\n[L1149] The Semi-Tensor Product (STP) of matrices, introduced by Cheng [Cheng, 2001], represents\r\n[L1150] the most closely related prior art. STP was developed to generalize the conventional matrix\r\n[L1151] product to handle dimension-mismatched matrices, and has been successfully applied to Boolean\r\n[L1152] networks, game theory, and control systems [Cheng et al., 2011]. While both VSLA and STP\r\n[L1153] address dimension mismatch, they are fundamentally different in their motivation, mechanism,\r\n[L1154] and algebraic structure.\r\n[L1155] • Motivation and Philosophy: STP is product-centric, designed to generalize the matrix\r\n[L1156] product ‘A * B‘. VSLA is object-centric, designed to define a rigorous algebra for variable\u0002dimension objects themselves, starting with the definition of an equivalence class.\r\n[L1157] • Mechanism: STP handles dimension mismatch via constructive lifting, using the Kro\u0002necker product to expand matrices to a common dimension. VSLA uses abstract coercion\r\n[L1158] based on equivalence classes, operating on minimal, sparse-by-design representatives with\u0002out materializing padded forms.\r\n[L1159] • Algebraic Foundation: VSLA is founded on dual semiring models from the outset\r\n[L1160] (Convolution/Polynomial and Kronecker), providing two distinct algebraic toolkits. The\r\n[L1161] algebraic properties of STP are a consequence of its product definition.\r\n[L1162] 20",

            "[L1164] • Operator Set: VSLA introduces higher-level compositional operators, such as the Stack\u0002ing Operator (S) and Windowing Operator (Ω), which have no direct equivalent in the\r\n[L1165] STP literature and are designed for building hierarchical data structures.\r\n[L1166] In summary, VSLA is not a derivative of STP but an independently developed, complemen\u0002tary algebraic system. It provides a formal foundation for the type of ragged tensor operations\r\n[L1167] found in modern ML frameworks, with a strong emphasis on sparsity and compositional, hier\u0002archical data structures.\r\n[L1168] 11 Gradient Support and Integration\r\n[L1169] 11.1 Formalization of VJPs for VSLA Operations\r\n[L1170] Automatic differentiation in VSLA requires defining custom Vector-Jacobian Products (VJPs)\r\n[L1171] that respect the variable-shape nature of the tensors. Building on established AD theory\r\n[L1172] [Griewank and Walther, 2008, Pearlmutter, 1994], we extend reverse-mode differentiation to\r\n[L1173] handle shape-changing operations. For an operation f : Dn → Dm, the goal is to compute\r\n[L1174] the action of the transposed Jacobian on a cotangent vector without explicitly forming the\r\n[L1175] Jacobian matrix.\r\n[L1176] Let y = f(x1, . . . , xn) and let ¯y be the cotangent vector (gradient) with respect to y. The\r\n[L1177] VJP for each input xiis ¯xi = J\r\n[L1178] T\r\n[L1179] i\r\n[L1180] y¯, where Jiis the Jacobian of f with respect to xi.\r\n[L1181] VJP for VSLA Addition: Let y = x1 + x2. The operation involves padding to an\r\n[L1182] ambient shape damb = max(vdim(x1), vdim(x2)). The forward operation is y = ιd1→damb (x1) +\r\n[L1183] ιd2→damb (x2). The Jacobian is composed of padding and un-padding operations. The VJP is\r\n[L1184] therefore:\r\n[L1185] x¯1 = unpromd1\r\n[L1186] (¯y), x¯2 = unpromd2\r\n[L1187] (¯y)\r\n[L1188] This corresponds to slicing the incoming gradient ¯y to match the original shapes of x1 and x2.\r\n[L1189] VJP for VSLA Convolution (Model A): Let y = x1 ⊗c x2. This is equivalent to\r\n[L1190] polynomial multiplication Y (z) = X1(z)X2(z). The gradients are given by convolution with\r\n[L1191] the reversed other operand:\r\n[L1192] x¯1 = ¯y ⊗c rev(x2), x¯2 = rev(x1) ⊗c y¯\r\n[L1193] where rev(x) denotes the coefficient vector in reverse order. The shapes of the resulting gradients\r\n[L1194] must be handled carefully to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L1195] VJP for Stacking Operator: Let Y = Sk(x1, . . . , xk). The forward operation pads each\r\n[L1196] xi to an ambient shape n and concatenates them. The VJP is the reverse operation: it unstacks\r\n[L1197] the incoming gradient Y¯ and un-pads each resulting slice to match the original input shapes.\r\n[L1198] x¯i = unpromvdim(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L1199] where (Y¯ )iis the i-th slice of the gradient tensor along the stacking dimension.\r\n[L1200] Theorem 11.1 (VJP Correctness for Minimal-Storage Layout). The VJP formulas above are\r\n[L1201] correct regardless of whether tensors are stored in post-padding or minimal-representative layout.\r\n[L1202] Proof. The key insight is that VJP correctness depends only on the mathematical equivalence\r\n[L1203] relation, not the physical storage layout.\r\n[L1204] Forward Operation Independence: In VSLA, the stacking operator Sk is defined on equiva\u0002lence classes [xi\r\n[L1205] ] ∈ D, not on specific representatives. Whether xiis stored as a minimal vector\r\n[L1206] of dimension vdim(xi) or as a post-padded vector of dimension n, the mathematical result\r\n[L1207] Y = Sk([x1], . . . , [xk]) is identical by definition of equivalence classes.\r\n[L1208] 21",

            "[L1210] Gradient Propagation: During backward pass, the gradient Y¯ has the same mathematical\r\n[L1211] shape as Y regardless of how the forward inputs were stored. The unstack operation (Y¯ )i\r\n[L1212] extracts the i-th slice, yielding a tensor of ambient shape n.\r\n[L1213] Unpromotion Operation: The unpromshape(xi) operation is a projection that extracts the\r\n[L1214] components corresponding to the original shape. This projection is mathematically well-defined\r\n[L1215] and gives the correct gradient regardless of storage:\r\n[L1216] • Minimal storage case: If xi was stored as dimension shape(xi), then unpromshape(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L1217] extracts exactly the relevant gradient components.\r\n[L1218] • Post-padding case: If xi was stored as dimension n with trailing zeros, then unpromshape(xi)((Y¯ )i)\r\n[L1219] still extracts the same relevant gradient components, since the trailing components of (Y¯ )i\r\n[L1220] correspond to derivatives with respect to padding zeros, which contribute zero to the total\r\n[L1221] derivative.\r\n[L1222] Chain Rule Verification: For any differentiable function f(Y ), the chain rule gives:\r\n[L1223] ∂f\r\n[L1224] ∂xi\r\n[L1225] =\r\n[L1226] ∂f\r\n[L1227] ∂Y\r\n[L1228] ∂Y\r\n[L1229] ∂xi\r\n[L1230] = Y¯ · Ji\r\n[L1231] where Jiis the Jacobian of Sk with respect to xi. The Jacobian Ji has the block structure\r\n[L1232] Ji = [padn, 0, . . . , 0] regardless of input storage layout, since mathematical padding is the same\r\n[L1233] operation whether applied to minimal or pre-padded representations.\r\n[L1234] Therefore, ¯xi = J\r\n[L1235] T\r\n[L1236] i Y¯ = unpromvdim(xi)\r\n[L1237] ((Y¯ )i) is correct for both storage layouts. □\r\n[L1238] 11.2 Framework Integration\r\n[L1239] Automatic Differentiation: VSLA operations are differentiable with custom vector-Jacobian\r\n[L1240] products (VJPs):\r\n[L1241] PyTorch Integration Example\r\n[L1242] class VSLAAdd(torch.autograd.Function):\r\n[L1243] @staticmethod\r\n[L1244] def forward(ctx, x, y):\r\n[L1245] ctx.save_for_backward(x, y)\r\n[L1246] return vsla_add(x, y) # automatic shape promotion\r\n[L1247] @staticmethod\r\n[L1248] def backward(ctx, grad_output):\r\n[L1249] x, y = ctx.saved_tensors\r\n[L1250] # Gradients respect original shapes\r\n[L1251] grad_x = grad_output[:x.shape[0], :x.shape[1]]\r\n[L1252] grad_y = grad_output[:y.shape[0], :y.shape[1]]\r\n[L1253] return grad_x, grad_y\r\n[L1254] # Usage in neural networks\r\n[L1255] x = VSLATensor([1, 2, 3]) # shape (3,)\r\n[L1256] y = VSLATensor([4, 5, 6, 7]) # shape (4,)\r\n[L1257] z = VSLAAdd.apply(x, y) # shape (4,), z = [5,7,9,7]\r\n[L1258] loss = z.sum()\r\n[L1259] loss.backward() # gradients flow correctly\r\n[L1260] JAX Custom Call Integration: Similar integration possible via jax.custom call with\r\n[L1261] XLA primitives for GPU acceleration.\r\n[L1262] 22",

            "# Research Proposal\n\n**Title:** Variable-Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA)–Driven Autonomous Physics Discovery Engine for Multi‑Scale (Sub‑Nuclear → Emergent) Universe Simulation\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a *self‑contained* next‑phase research program that operationalizes the already proven Variable‑Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA) framework and existing optimized C core into an **autonomous physics discovery engine**. The guiding ambition is to *simulate our universe with the minimum necessary active degrees of freedom*—selectively descending toward the smallest meaningful (Planck‑motivated) length/time scales **only where** local informational gain justifies cost—while *searching the rule space itself* for new invariant structures, candidate symmetries, and simplified microphysical interaction forms. VSLA’s rigorously defined shape‑aware semiring algebra eliminates explicit zero‑padding, allowing dynamic birth/death of local degrees of freedom (DoFs) without global reshaping and enabling differentiable + combinatorial optimization directly over changing state and operator graphs. We integrate adaptive multi‑scale refinement, gradient and evolutionary meta‑optimization, symbolic rule rewriting, and automated invariant mining in a reproducible, distributed HPC architecture. Success yields (1) a reference implementation proving that **VSLA fundamentally outperforms traditional padded, ragged, or CSR/COO sparse approaches** for dynamically structured physics, (2) a library of discovered conserved or near‑conserved quantities emerging from rule exploration, and (3) a generalized methodology for minimal‑DoF, maximal‑information simulation across scientific domains.\n\n**Status Context:** The VSLA mathematical framework is *already proven* (theory + prior paper) and an optimized C core library exists and is being prepared for open source release. This proposal covers the *next phase*: applying VSLA to build an adaptive, hypothesis‑generating universe simulator that can (1) efficiently evolve candidate microphysical rules, and (2) autonomously search for new invariants / structures beyond currently encoded physics.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nWe will construct an autonomous simulation platform that marries VSLA’s dimension‑aware sparse algebra with large‑scale heterogeneous compute to explore candidate fundamental dynamics. Instead of attempting an infeasible, literal full Planck‑resolution spacetime, we target *adaptive local descent toward sub‑nuclear (and Planck‑motivated) regimes* where needed, while coarser emergent scales are compressed via hierarchical VSLA tensor pyramids. A meta‑optimization loop (gradient‑based + evolutionary + symbolic search) operates over a *rule space* (interaction kernels, semiring compositions, constraint projections) to discover candidate laws consistent with target phenomenology and internal consistency metrics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Refined Problem Statement\n\nClassical lattice / grid simulations face three intertwined blockers to exploratory microphysics:\n\n1. **Inflexible Shape & Padding Overhead:** Fixed global shapes materialize vast inactive vacuum regions.\n2. **Static Rule Embedding:** Most frameworks hard‑code interaction forms; exploring variants is manual & slow.\n3. **Poor Meta‑Learning Hooks:** Traditional sparse formats (CSR, COO, block) lack algebraic closure for seamless differentiable / combinatorial search over changing degrees of freedom.\n\nWe seek a platform that *treats both physical state and rule definitions as differentiable, composable objects within a rigorously defined variable‑shape semiring algebra*, enabling:\n\n- Dynamic insertion/removal of local degrees of freedom (DoFs) without global reshaping.\n- On‑the‑fly selection of interaction operators (convolutional locality, Kronecker entanglement, custom semirings) guided by performance & fidelity signals.\n- Gradient flow through variable‑shape operations plus non‑gradient (evolutionary / symbolic) exploration for discontinuous structural changes.\n\n**Key VSLA Advantage:** Unlike ragged tensors (which loosen shape constraints) or traditional sparse matrices (which discard algebraic structure), VSLA preserves full linear‑algebraic identities *under automatic shape promotion*. This enables formal reasoning (optimization legality, invariant preservation) while retaining sparse‑by‑design efficiency.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

System Architecture Overview\n\nWe decompose the platform into **two cooperating macro‑systems**:\n\n1. **HPC Simulation Core (HPC Domain):** Runs the *large, tightly coupled*, latency‑sensitive adaptive simulations (regions undergoing high activity or deep refinement). Emphasis: low‑latency interconnect (InfiniBand / NVLink), NUMA‑aware memory placement, GPU acceleration, deterministic high‑throughput kernels.\n2. **Federated Exploration & Orchestration Layer (FEOL Domain):** A *wide, loosely coupled* mesh of orchestrated jobs spanning internal clusters + community donor machines. Emphasis: embarrassingly parallel workloads (parameter sweeps, micro‑universe probes, rule mutation evaluation, invariant validation, post‑processing analytics) with tolerant networking (public internet) and heterogenous hardware.\n\n### 3.1 Architectural Planes\n\n| Plane                            | HPC Domain Role                                                                         | FEOL Domain Role                                                                          | Shared Artifacts                                              |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Control Plane**                | SLURM/MPI launcher;

futures resolved before boundary-dependent kernels.\n- **Compression Tiering:** LZ4 for halos (low latency), Zstandard for checkpoint archival, optional quantization (8/16‑bit) for *exploratory* micro‑universe seeds (tagged to avoid contaminating high‑fidelity invariants).\n\n### 3.6 Load Balancing Strategy\n\n1. **Predictive Model:** EWMA + small RNN predictor forecasting per‑region compute cost (based on recent ops counts, active DoF growth rate, refinement frequency).\n2. **Partition Reassignment:** If predicted imbalance > θ\\_lb, migrate least-coupled regions (low boundary traffic) first to minimize halo cost. Migration uses double-buffering with checksum validation.\n3. **Refinement Budgeting:** Global controller caps simultaneous refinement expansions to B\\_max per cycle; queue over-budget requests prioritized by expected information gain (variance \\* inverse compute cost).\n\n### 3.7 Fault Tolerance & Integrity\n\n- **Region-Level Checkpoint Cadence:** Fast incremental (delta) every M steps, full snapshot every K·M steps.\n- **Consensus on Rule Promotion:** Quorum (configurable majority) of independent micro‑universe validation scores before high-fidelity adoption.\n- **Deterministic Replay:** Identical seeds + version pins reproduce divergent runs for debugging; divergence fingerprint stored if mismatch > ε.\n- **Integrity Hash Chain:** Each Rule Graph Diff includes parent hash; checkpoints embed current rule version hash for cross-verification.\n\n### 3.8 Security & Sandbox Considerations (Community Workers)\n\n- Sandboxed execution (WASM / container) limiting syscalls.\n- Signed payloads (rule diff, checkpoint shard) verified before execution.\n- Resource / result attestation (optional SGX or TPM quote) recorded when available to increase trust in contributed scores.\n\n### 3.9 ASCII Topology Overview\n\n```\n                +------------------+          +----------------------+\n                |  Provenance &    |<-------->|  Rule / Invariant    |\n                |  Run Registry    |          |  Archive (Postgres)  |\n                +---------+--------+          +-----------+----------+\n                          ^                               ^\n                          |                               |\n     (High-BW Fabric)     |                               |   (Public / Hybrid Network)\n+-------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------+\n|                                      Control Plane                                     |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                Orchestrator (Spring Batch)                             |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n   ^                               ^                                 ^\n   |                               |                                 |\n   |                               |                                 |\n   |                    +----------+-----------+            +--------+--------+\n   |                    | Mutation Generator  |            |  Result Aggreg.  |\n   |                    +----------+-----------+            +--------+--------+\n   |                               |                                 |\n   |                               v                                 |\n   |                    +----------------------+                     |\n   |                    |  Community Workers   |<--------------------+\n   |                    | (Micro-Universe,     |\n   |                    |  Simplifier, Surrog.)|\n   |                    +----------+-----------+\n   |                               |\n   |    High-Fidelity Promoted     |\n   |    Rule Candidates            |\n   |                               v\n+--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                   HPC Simulation Core (SLURM/MPI Cluster)                   |\n| +----------------+   +----------------+   +----------------+                |\n| | Region Manager |-->| VSLA Kernels   |-->| Gradient Engine|--+             |\n| +--------+-------+   +--------+-------+   +--------+-------+  |             |\n|          |                  ^                    ^           |             |\n|          v                  |                    |           |             |\n|   Refinement Engine   Halo Exchange Service   Invariant Calc |             |\n|          |                                                 | |             |\n|          +---------------------Telemetry--------------------+-+             |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n### 3.10 Distinguishing Roles of the Two Macro‑Systems\n\n| Aspect              | HPC Core                                    | Federated Layer                       |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Primary Objective   | High-fidelity evolution & precise gradients | Breadth of exploration & rapid triage |\n| Workload Type       | Latency & bandwidth sensitive               | Latency tolerant, throughput oriented |\n| Failure Handling    | Low tolerance (checkpoint restart)          | High tolerance (drop/retry tasks)     |\n| Data Freshness Need | Immediate (per step)                        | Periodic / batched                    |\n| Precision           | Full (fp32/fp64 selectable)                 | Mixed / reduced precision allowed     |\n| Security Emphasis   | Cluster trust boundary                      | Untrusted nodes, sandbox + signatures |\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Reproducibility & Provenance\n\n- Deterministic kernels selectable (sacrificing some throughput).\n- Each simulation run logs: git commit of VSLA & physics kernels, semiring catalog hash, rule graph diff history, RNG seeds, hardware fingerprint.\n- Checkpoints: content-addressed (SHA-256) bundles with manifest of shape metadata & parameter vector; provenance graph enabling rollback & lineage queries.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Open Source & Community Strategy\n\n- License: Permissive (MIT / Apache 2.0) to maximize adoption.\n- Modular plugin interfaces for new semirings, refinement policies, invariant mining strategies.\n- Public benchmark repository & CI including deterministic regression tests and performance tracking across reference GPUs.\n- Governance: Lightweight steering group (core maintainers + rotating external reviewers) for rule search contributions.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Ethical & Sustainability Considerations\n\n- **Energy Footprint:** Publish energy metrics per benchmark (kWh / simulated step) and optimize for Joules/DoF-step.\n- **Openness vs. Misuse:** Focus is fundamental physics discovery; no direct dual-use risk identified, but we will document limitations.\n- **Community Compute Integration:** Idle community nodes limited to parameter sweeps & post-processing to avoid misleading claims of full-scale distributed Planck simulation.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Future Extensions (Post Phase 5)\n\n1. **Higher-Order Autodiff:** Sparse Hessian / mixed forward-reverse mode for curvature-aware rule fitting.\n2. **Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks:** Integrate Kronecker semiring variants with entanglement entropy estimators.\n3. **Probabilistic Rule Ensembles:** Bayesian model averaging over rule graphs with stochastic refinement policies.\n4. **Differentiable Compiler Passes:** Automatic fusion & kernel generation guided by cost models learned from telemetry.\n5. **Invariant Certificates:** Formal verification (SMT / abstract interpretation) for candidate conserved laws on restricted subsystems.\n6. **Edge & FPGA Backends:** Low-power subset for localized high-resolution bursts (e.g. near emergent event horizons in simulation).\n\n---\n\n## 14. Expected Impact\n\nThis project operationalizes VSLA from proven algebraic theory into a *practical autonomous physics discovery engine*. Success yields:\n\n- A reference architecture for variable-shape differentiable simulation at scale.\n- Novel candidate invariants / simplified interaction forms for toy microphysical models.\n- A reusable meta-optimization stack for other domains (chemistry, adaptive PDEs, graph dynamics) where DoF cardinality is intrinsically dynamic.\n\n---\n\n## 15. Summary\n\nWe transition from VSLA’s foundational theory to an applied, adaptive simulation and discovery platform. By unifying sparse-by-design algebra, meta-rule search, and hierarchical refinement under a reproducible HPC framework, we systematically explore new physical structures while maintaining computational tractability. The outcome is not a brute force Planck-scale replica, but an *intelligent, multi-scale engine* that selectively approaches extreme resolutions only where informational yield justifies cost—and learns how the rules themselves might elegantly reorganize.\n\n---\n\n**Contact / Maintainers:** (To populate)\n\n**Appendices (Optional to Add Later):**\n\n- A: Formal Semiring Interface Spec Extension\n- B: Rule Graph Mutation Grammar\n- C: Invariant Mining Algorithmic Details\n- D: Benchmark Dataset Definitions\n\n"

Three lightweight encoders handle 1-step (\\\"reflex\\\"), 10-step (\\\"burst\\\"), and 50-step (\\\"context\\\") views of streaming data; their representations are fused by an aggregator module trained end-to-end. We hypothesize that this design outperforms monolithic long-window models on accuracy-latency trade-offs while enabling asynchronous clocks that mimic biological fast–slow cognition.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Executive Summary\\n* **Gap:** VSLA theory introduces multiresolution tensor pyramids but no empirical demonstration within neural learning.\\n* **Innovation:** A tri-branch, shape-aware neural network leveraging VSLA promotion for zero-copy multiscale batching; asynchronous encoder clocks for computational parsimony.\\n* **Outcome:** Benchmarks on physiological, financial, and industrial streams showing superior accuracy–latency Pareto fronts and open-source PyTorch-VSLA bridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1  Introduction & Context\\nVSLA guarantees algebraic closure under automatic shape promotion, removing the padding overhead that plagues ragged or dense time-series tensors. This opens a path to real-time multiscale inference where each additional temporal resolution costs Θ(N) copy only once at ingest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2  Problem Statement\\nSingle-window models must rediscover short-lived events buried inside long sequences, demanding deeper kernels or attention spreads. We seek a principled architecture that:\\n1. **Captures events across multiple horizons simultaneously.**\\n2. **Controls inference latency by clocking branches at different rates.**\\n3. **Stays memory-efficient on sparse or bursty streams using VSLA.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3  Core Innovation\\n| Layer | Contribution | VSLA Leverage |\\n|-------|--------------|---------------|\\n| **Window Pyramid** | Build \\\\{1,10,50\\\\}-step tensors every tick. | `Ω_w` & `S_k` stack without padding. |\\n| **Branch Encoders** | Causal 1-D CNN / TCN tailored per resolution. | Shapes preserved; no manual masking. |\\n| **Aggregator** | Concatenation + MLP or cross-scale attention. | Shared leading-axis semantics guaranteed. |\\n| **Asynchronous Clocks** | Run 1-step every tick, 10-step every 5 ticks, 50-step every 25. | VSLA promotion amortises update cost. |\\n| **Zero-Copy Gradients** | Custom VJPs unstack during back-prop. | Provided by VSLA library. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4  System Architecture Overview\\n```\\nraw stream ─┬─► Level-1 Encoder (Δt = 1)\\n            ├─► Level-2 Encoder (Δt = 10)\\n            └─► Level-3 Encoder (Δt = 50)\\n                     ↓↓\\n              Multiscale Aggregator\\n                     ↓↓\\n                 Task Heads (CLS / REG)\\n```\\n* **Implementation:** PyTorch + VSLA C/CUDA kernels; mixed precision; single RTX 5090 (32 GB) for research scale.\\n* **Pipeline:** VSLA pyramid on CPU → pinned memory → GPU encoders → aggregator → task-specific heads.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5  Research Questions & Hypotheses\\n1. **H1:** Tri-branch VSLA-pyramid models achieve lower validation loss than single 50-step models at equal FLOPs.\\n2. **H2:** Asynchronous clocks reduce average latency ≥40 % with <2 % degradation in accuracy.\\n3. **H3:** VSLA promotion overhead is <5 % of total training time on RTX 5090.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6  Experimental Protocol\\n| Dataset Domain | Example Corpus | Horizon (steps) | Metric |\\n|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|\\n| Physiological   | MIT-BIH ECG    | 5 s @ 360 Hz     | AUROC  |\\n| Finance        | LOB-Ster 14     | 100 ms ticks     | F1 / Latency |\\n| Industrial IoT | UCI Gas Sensor | 1 Hz             | MAE    |\\n\\n**Baselines:**\\n* Single 50-step TCN\\n* Dilated TCN (WaveNet)\\n* Long-former Transformer (local attention)\\n\\n**Ablations:**\\n* Remove 1-step branch\\n* Remove 10-step branch\\n* Synchronous vs. asynchronous clocks\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7  Evaluation Metrics\\n* Task accuracy (domain-specific)\\n* Average inference latency (ms)\\n* Energy-per-prediction (Joules)\\n* Parameter count & VRAM footprint\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8  Implementation Plan & Milestones\\n| Phase | Months | Goals | Deliverables |\\n|-------|--------|-------|--------------|\\n| 0 | 0-1 | VSLA-PyTorch bridge | OSS repo v0.1, CI tests |\\n| 1 | 1-2 | Single-branch baseline | Training scripts, baseline report |\\n| 2 | 2-4 | Tri-branch synchronous | Demo accuracy lift |\\n| 3 | 4-5 | Asynchronous scheduler | Latency study whitepaper |\\n| 4 | 5-6 | Ablation & robustness | Extended experiments preprint |\\n| 5 | 6-8 | Community beta & docs | v1.0 release, reproducible notebooks |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9  Risk Analysis & Mitigation\\n| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |\\n|------|--------|-----------|\\n| VSLA CUDA kernels delayed | Slower training | Fallback to CPU pyramid + GPU encoders; kernel benchmarking early |\\n| Overfitting small datasets | Weak conclusions | Use cross-domain corpora & data augmentation |\\n| Clock desynchronization complexities | Engineering overhead | Begin with synchronous prototype, gradually introduce async |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10  Resource Requirements\\n* **Hardware:** 1 × RTX 5090 (provided), 64 GB system RAM, 2 TB NVMe.\\n* **Software:** PyTorch ≥2.3, VSLA-core, CUDA 13.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 11  Expected Impact\\nDemonstrates that VSLA’s algebraic multiresolution foundation yields tangible gains in real-time inference, paving the way for adaptive cognition-inspired networks in edge and HPC settings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 12  Open Source & Community Strategy\\n* MIT license; permissive to maximise adoption.\\n* Modular encoder/aggregator interface.\\n* Reproducible pipelines; CI on GitHub Actions.\\n* Invite community to suggest new window hierarchies or domain benchmarks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 13  Ethical Considerations\\nEnsure datasets have appropriate usage licenses; monitor potential bias across demographic slices; publish energy metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 14  Summary\\nBy uniting VSLA’s zero-copy tensor pyramids with a multi-encoder neural design, this project delivers a compelling next-step research path that complements and rivals adaptive physics simulation work—focusing instead on *hierarchical reasoning for time-series AI*.
