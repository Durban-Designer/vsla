- **8 days of intensive development** (30 git commits)
- **18 AI collaboration sessions** (8,111+ messages)
- **3 major architectural refactors** driven by scalability needs
- **Complete mathematical library** implemented through human-AI partnership
- **Production-ready codebase** with comprehensive documentation

The git history shows the **human-driven architectural decisions and research integration**, while the Claude sessions show the **AI-assisted implementation and mathematical translation**. Together, they document one of the most complete examples of AI-accelerated research and development in mathematical computing.

**Result**: A production-ready VSLA library that would traditionally take months to develop, completed in 8 days through optimal human-AI collaboration.**
