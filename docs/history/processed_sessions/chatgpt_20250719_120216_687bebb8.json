      "content": "I can’t literally “find every single paper” that *exists* on the semi-tensor product (STP) (the corpus spans hundreds of items across journals, conference proceedings, arXiv preprints, theses, and a growing set of generalizations). What I *can* do is (a) outline the core foundational literature by Cheng and principal co-authors (Qi, Xue, etc.), (b) list major monographs / surveys, (c) highlight important thematic application clusters, (d) note newer extensions (dimension-keeping STP, second STP, generalized / hypermatrix / compound products), and (e) give you a reproducible strategy to continue compiling and vetting the bibliography. citeturn0search1\n\n### 1. Foundational & Early Survey Works (Core Starting Set)\n\n- Initial introductions / early surveys and book chapters establishing STP formalism and properties and summarizing applications across dynamics, logic, differential geometry, algebra. citeturn0search1turn0search3turn0search14\n- Monograph treatments consolidating theory and broad applications (matrix/differential calculus framing, algebraic + differential parts of STP). citeturn0search14turn0search13\n- Early application-focused chapter(s) emphasizing dynamic systems control perspective. citeturn0search7\n- Later concise chapter / survey reiterating pseudo-commutativity and scalar-like behavior (helps differentiate from Kronecker & Hadamard products). citeturn0search10turn0search8\n\n### 2. Key Generalizations & Theoretical Extensions\n\n- Generalised (or “generalized”) STP expanding flexibility and motivating broader control / network applications. citeturn0search15\n- Dimension-Keeping STP (DK-STP) introduced for observer-based realization to maintain state dimension; uses bridge matrices and exact / approximate realization conditions. citeturn0search0turn0search12\n- “Second” semi-tensor product (alternative construction replacing factors in original definition) with solvability analyses of associated matrix equations. citeturn0search6\n- Compound product of hypermatrices (extension of STP to higher-order tensors / hypermatrices plus hyperdeterminants and associated Lie structures). citeturn0search2\n\n### 3. Comprehensive Topical Surveys Beyond the Original (Domain-Specific)\n\n- Finite / networked games: dedicated survey compiling STP-based game representations, equilibrium computation methods, dynamic / evolutionary game analysis. citeturn0search17\n- (Emerging) Cross-domain workshop & community dissemination (e.g., dedicated workshop materials showing breadth of ongoing development). citeturn0search16\n\n### 4. Representative Application Domains & Sample Papers\n\n| Domain | Representative STP-focused Contributions (Illustrative, not exhaustive) | Notes |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Control & Dynamical Systems | Observer-based realization with DK-STP; generalized STP in control literature. citeturn0search0turn0search12turn0search15 | Dimension handling, realization, linearization, switched / Boolean systems. |\n| Boolean / Logical (incl. multi-valued / fuzzy) Networks & Logic | Early surveys + generalized STP referencing logic/algebra framework. citeturn0search1turn0search10 | Matrix expression of logical operators; model checking, controllability of logical / Boolean networks (follow-up papers you can mine from citations within these sources). |\n| Finite & Networked Games | Comprehensive finite games survey. citeturn0search17 | Normal-form encoding, potential games analysis, dynamic updates. |\n| Power & Energy / Stability Regions | Foundational survey touches power system stability (boundary approximation via STP). citeturn0search1 | For deeper dive, trace cited works inside survey & later generalized STP papers. |\n| Algebra / Lie Theory | Hypermatrix compound product constructing Lie groups/algebras. citeturn0search2 | Structure matrix methods extend classical identities. |\n| Neural / Cognitive Models | Associative memory model leveraging STP for capacity & storage in DHNN. citeturn0search4 |\n| Matrix / Equation Theory | Solvability of second STP equations (AX ∘ B forms). citeturn0search6 |\n| Textbook / Pedagogical Consolidation | Monograph & chapter intros. citeturn0search13turn0search14 |\n\n### 5. Author Publication Source\n\nFor the most authoritative and near-complete list of Daizhan Cheng’s publications (including many STP items not all indexed uniformly in general searches), consult his maintained publication list and then filter for titles explicitly containing “semi-tensor product,” “STP,” “dimension-keeping,” “second semi-tensor,” or related compound product terms. citeturn0search7\n\n### 6. Strategy to Expand Toward a (More) Complete Bibliography\n\n1. **Seed Set Extraction**: Start from the 2007 survey’s reference list and the monograph’s bibliography (monograph catalog entry for context). citeturn0search1turn0search13  \n2. **Forward Citation Chaining**: Use citation databases (Google Scholar / Web of Science / Scopus) on foundational survey & monograph DOIs; export citing works filtered by title/abstract containing “semi-tensor product” or acronym “STP” in matrix contexts (exclude unrelated uses of STP acronym). citeturn0search10  \n3. **Author-Centric Queries**: Combine core authors (“Cheng” with “semi-tensor”, “Hongsheng Qi”, “Ancheng Xue”, later collaborators) plus newer terms: “dimension-keeping”, “second semi-tensor”, “compound product of hypermatrices”. citeturn0search0turn0search2turn0search6  \n4. **Generalization Keywords**: Add “Boolean networks”, “finite games”, “observer-based realization”, “hypermatrix”, “hyperdeterminant” alongside “semi-tensor”. citeturn0search2turn0search17  \n5. **Temporal Sweep**: Run year-bounded searches (e.g., 2015–2018, 2019–2021, 2022–2025) to catch waves of application (games, DK-STP, second STP, compound product). citeturn0search0turn0search6  \n6. **Validate Novelty**: Distinguish between papers *using* STP as a tool versus those *extending* its algebraic definition (focus on latter for “on this subject”). citeturn0search15turn0search2  \n7. **De-duplicate Terminology**: Some works restate earlier results in broader surveys (avoid counting chapter + journal duplication twice without noting format). citeturn0search14turn0search10  \n\n### 7. Interpreting “On This Subject” vs “Authored by These Researchers”\n\nIf by “these researchers” you mean specifically the three authors of the 2007 survey (Cheng, Qi, Xue), prioritize:\n- Survey article itself. citeturn0search1\n- Monographs / chapters they co-authored (e.g., 2012 book includes Cheng & Qi). citeturn0search13\n- Subsequent theoretical generalizations where Cheng remains (co)author (DK-STP, second STP, generalized STP, finite games survey). citeturn0search0turn0search6turn0search15turn0search17\n- Hypermatrix compound / higher-order product papers where the STP is explicitly generalized (check author list for Cheng or close collaborators; the concept builds directly atop STP). citeturn0search2  \n\nIf you intended **“all papers globally”** on STP, that extends beyond their authorship to community adoption in Boolean control networks, game theory, neuroscience, etc. (illustrated above). citeturn0search4turn0search17turn0search15\n\n### 8. Managing Scope & Next Steps\n\nBecause the literature is active (new generalizations still appearing in 2024–2025), any static list becomes outdated quickly; setting up periodic citation alerts on the seed survey and monograph keeps the bibliography fresh. citeturn0search1turn0search10\n\n---\n\n**Let me know**:  \n- Do you want a structured BibTeX file for the current core set?  \n- Should I focus only on works *extending the algebra itself* (exclude application papers)?  \n- Or build an annotated bibliography by domain?\n\nGive me that preference and I can generate the next deliverable. citeturn0search1",
