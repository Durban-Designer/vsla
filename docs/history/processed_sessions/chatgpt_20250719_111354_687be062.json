If the paper lives in Google Drive / another repo that isn’t connected here, I won’t see it until that connector is set up or you paste / upload the content.\n2. **Different naming** – maybe the doc title doesn’t literally contain “v0.3” or “VSLA”. If you can give me:\n   - Exact (or approximate) title wording\n   - Any unique phrases in the abstract / first paragraph\n   - The date of the chat or meeting where we discussed it\n3. **You can paste or upload the text/PDF** (even partial) and I can work from that.\n4. **If you want me to keep looking**, let me know other keywords (e.g., project codename, author names, internal ticket IDs).\n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed—provide more keywords, upload the doc, or clarify where it’s stored—and I’ll take the next step.",
