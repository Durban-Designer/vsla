      "content": "# Precedents for the Stacking Operator (Σ)\n\n**Similar concepts in existing literature:** The idea of “stacking” variable-shaped tensors by padding them to a common size is not entirely new – it appears in practical contexts even if not under the same name. In deep learning frameworks, for example, **TensorFlow’s Ragged Tensors** provide a `tf.ragged.stack` operation that stacks a list of tensors of unequal lengths into a higher-rank ragged tensor【8†L5641-L5649】. This is essentially the same idea as the VSLA stacking operator Σ: each tensor is embedded in a larger shape (via padding) and assembled into one higher-dimensional tensor. **PyTorch’s NestedTensor** type offers a similar mechanism for batching sequences of different lengths without manual padding【24†L251-L259】. In both cases, the frameworks allow collecting variable-length arrays into a single tensor-like object, preserving the varying shapes internally. Thus, the operation that Σ performs – concatenating or aggregating heterogeneously-shaped tensors into a higher-rank tensor by zero-padding to a common “ambient” shape【6†L31-L39】【6†L49-L57】 – has clear precedents in these systems (even if those systems did not assign a dedicated mathematical symbol to it). \n\n**Prior mathematical notions:** While classical linear algebra doesn’t have a standard named operator for “stacking,” related concepts exist. For example, one can think of stacking as a form of block vector or matrix construction. In practice, authors often use notation like $\\mathrm{col}(A_1,\\dots,A_n)$ or an explicit block vector notation $[A_1; A_2; \\cdots; A_n]$ to denote stacking vectors or matrices vertically【17†L149-L157】. There is *no single universally accepted symbol* for this operation in the literature【17†L149-L157】, which is why introducing Σ without context might be confusing (more on that below). However, the mathematical operation of embedding lower-dimensional vectors into a higher-dimensional space by padding with zeros is well-known in functional analysis and numerical linear algebra. In fact, the **direct sum of vector spaces** is a related concept: if we treat each length-$n$ vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as naturally embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ for $m \\ge n$ by appending zeros, then stacking k such vectors of differing lengths corresponds to taking a direct sum (which yields a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n_1+\\cdots+n_k}$). The VSLA paper’s Σ operator formalizes this idea by using an *equivalence class of padded vectors* to represent each variable-shaped tensor【5†L7-L15】【5†L33-L41】, then “stacking” those equivalence classes. \n\n**Novelty of formalization:** The *concept* of stacking ragged tensors is thus not new – it appears in machine learning practice (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and can be related to long-standing linear algebra constructions (block matrices or direct sums). What **is** potentially novel is the rigorous algebraic formalization of this operation as an operator Σ with proven properties (associativity, functorial behavior, etc.)【6†L37-L45】. Traditional approaches to ragged tensors have been ad-hoc, focusing on implementation rather than algebraic laws. By contrast, VSLA defines stacking in a mathematically principled way (e.g. treating it as a **functor** from a monoidal category of tensor tuples to single tensors【30†L33-L41】, and proving identities like $Σ_m(Σ_k(A), Σ_k(B)) \\sim Σ_{mk}(A,B)$【30†L33-L41】). This level of formal treatment does appear to be original. We did not find prior literature that assigns an explicit operator and algebraic laws to a “stacking” or padding operation – most papers simply handle variable shapes as a programming detail rather than a first-class algebraic construct. One somewhat related line of research is the **semi-tensor product (STP)** of matrices proposed by Cheng *et al.*, which generalizes standard matrix multiplication to allow dimension mismatches by padding/tiling vectors as needed【29†L15-L23】. The STP framework shows that others have indeed considered *dimension-flexible operations* in linear algebra. However, STP is focused on multiplying matrices of nonconforming sizes, whereas VSLA’s Σ is about forming higher-rank tensors from lists of tensors. In summary, the operation itself (stacking with padding) has clear precedents in practice (ragged tensor stacking) and implicit analogues in math, but treating it as a standalone algebraic operator with formal properties is likely a new contribution of VSLA.\n\n# Precedents for the Window-Stacking Operator (Ω)\n\n**Similar concepts in signal processing and tensors:** The “window-stacking” operator Ω (which takes a streaming sequence and stacks every fixed-size window of length *w* into a higher-rank tensor【15†L753-L761】【15†L763-L770】) closely resembles standard techniques in signal processing and time-series analysis. In streaming data processing, it is common to divide a sequence into consecutive **windows or blocks** (sometimes called *tumbling windows* when non-overlapping) for batch processing【32†L123-L132】. For example, digital signal processing algorithms often segment an audio signal into frames of length *w* (with or without overlap) before processing. Mathematically, taking a length-*w* window every *w* steps and stacking them produces a block matrix or 2D array of shape (w, N/w). This is essentially what Ω accomplishes for a stream. There is ample precedent for this idea: constructing a higher-dimensional array from a 1D sequence via sliding or chunked windows is a known transformation. A notable example is the construction of **Hankel matrices** or **Toeplitz matrices** from time-series data. In time-series analysis, one often forms a Hankel matrix whose columns are consecutive subsequences (delay embeddings) of the original series【33†L238-L247】. This Hankel matrix is a stack of overlapping windows (each column is a window of the series, typically with a one-step slide). Ω with step = *w* (non-overlapping) is a special case of this idea (a *tumbling window* segmentation). The literature on Hankel matrices indicates the concept dates back to at least the 1960s–1980s in system identification and embedding theory【33†L238-L247】. In that sense, VSLA’s window-stacking operator has clear conceptual precedent: it’s essentially implementing a known transformation (segmenting a sequence into a matrix or tensor of windows). \n\n**Multi-resolution pyramids:** The VSLA paper specifically frames repeated window-stacking as forming *tensor pyramids*, drawing analogy to **Gaussian or Laplacian pyramids** in image processing【15†L773-L781】. Classical pyramids (Burt and Adelson, 1983) involve successively downsampling or aggregating an image to form a multi-scale hierarchy【31†L23-L31】. The general notion of multilevel aggregation is well-established – e.g. Gaussian pyramid each level reduces resolution, wavelet transforms build multi-scale representations (Mallat’s wavelet analysis textbook discusses such pyramids【15†L773-L781】). VSLA’s tensor pyramid differs in that it doesn’t necessarily downsample or filter; it *groups* variable-size blocks into higher-rank tensors but allows each level to have heterogeneous shapes. Still, the *spirit* of a hierarchical, multi-rank representation is similar to known multi-resolution techniques. Therefore, the window-stacking operator Ω is not an entirely novel operation in itself – it formalizes the process of batching a stream into fixed-size chunks. This process is ubiquitous in practice (often simply called “framing” or “blocking” in DSP). However, **like Σ, the novelty is in formalization**. VSLA defines Ω as an operator with a clear algebraic interface, whereas most prior references would treat windowing as a procedural step. We did not find an existing mathematical operator symbol or name dedicated to “window stacking” per se; it’s usually described in words (e.g. “reshape the data into a Hankel matrix”). So VSLA’s Ω operator appears to package a well-known idea in a new formal way. \n\n**Key references to cite:** For proper attribution, it would be wise to cite sources on sliding-window and pyramid methods. For instance, one could reference a standard text on multi-resolution analysis or the original pyramid paper by **Burt and Adelson (1983)** for the pyramid concept【31†L23-L31】. Additionally, citing work on **Hankel/delay embedding** (e.g. Takens’ embedding theorem or a recent survey of Hankel matrix methods) would acknowledge the long history of representing sequences as matrices【33†L238-L247】. These give scholarly context that the windowing and hierarchical grouping ideas have known precedents in signal processing and dynamical systems.\n\n# Notational Clarity: Σ and Ω Symbols\n\nUsing **Σ for a stacking operator** and **Ω for a windowed stacking operator** is potentially confusing because these Greek letters have established meanings in other contexts. **Σ (sigma)** is universally recognized as the summation symbol in mathematics. Readers might initially misinterpret an expression like $Σ(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k)$ as a sum of terms rather than a stacking of tensors. In fact, the StackExchange discussion on notation for stacking matrices explicitly noted that a symbol analogous to ∑ for stacking is not standard【17†L90-L97】【17†L149-L157】 – one respondent suggested using “col” or bracket notation precisely to avoid confusion with summation. Unless one reads the definition in the paper carefully, seeing Σ used in an algebraic expression could cause momentary ambiguity. Moreover, in tensor calculus, Σ might evoke the idea of an index summation (Einstein summation convention), which is unrelated to stacking. \n\n**Ω (omega)** is less overloaded in linear algebra, but it does have common uses that could clash subtly. In mathematics and computer science, Ω often denotes a space or sample set (especially in probability theory, Ω is the sample space) or is used in asymptotic notation (*Ω(n)* for lower bounds). In signal processing, lowercase ω typically represents angular frequency; uppercase Ω might suggest frequency domain variables or solid angles. While using Ω for a window operator is not as immediately misleading as Σ, it is still an unusual choice. A reader might wonder if Ω has some acronymic significance (perhaps “Omega” for “window” isn’t intuitive – one might expect *W* or another letter). \n\n**Alternative symbols or notations:** Given the potential for confusion, it could be worth choosing different notation that isn’t already tied to a well-known operation. One approach is to use a **descriptive operator name** instead of a Greek letter. For example, some texts would write $\\mathrm{stack}(x_1,\\dots,x_k)$ to explicitly denote stacking. In the absence of a standard symbol, even a boldface letter **S** or a script character could serve (for instance, using $\\mathcal{S}$ or a double-bracket notation). The StackExchange answer mentioned one common notation $\\mathrm{col}(A_1,\\ldots,A_n)$【17†L149-L157】 – in that spirit, something like $\\operatorname{Stack}(A,B,\\dots)$ could be clear. If a compact symbol is desired, one might consider a variant of the direct-sum symbol ⊕ or a concatenation symbol. For example, one could define $\\oplus$ to mean stacking (although ⊕ usually means direct sum in linear algebra, which is related but not identical). Another idea might be to use a **vertical bar or double vertical bar** notation to suggest “stacking” vertically or in depth. Any new symbol must be clearly defined, but at least picking a symbol that doesn’t immediately suggest a different standard operation would reduce ambiguity. In summary, **Σ and Ω are likely to cause momentary confusion** for readers, so it would be advisable to either redefine them very prominently or choose different notation. Perhaps Ω could be replaced with a subscripted version of the stack operator (e.g. $Σ^{(w)}$ for a window of length *w*), or a letter like **Psi (Ψ)** or **Theta (Θ)** that isn’t commonly used elsewhere. The goal should be to ensure that a skim-reader of the paper doesn’t mistakenly read $Σ$ as a sum or $Ω$ as a fancy constant. Since there is no entrenched notation for these operations, clarity should trump brevity – even writing “stack” and “w-stack” in prose or pseudo-code style could be clearer for a broad audience.\n\n# Intrinsic Tensor Dimensions as Algebraic Metadata\n\n**VSLA’s treatment of dimensions:** A core idea in VSLA is that the size or shape of a tensor is carried along as part of the data and affects computations – in other words, the **dimension is intrinsic** rather than just an external parameter. This is indeed a novel viewpoint compared to classical linear algebra, which fixes dimensions of vector spaces in advance. In VSLA, one defines a dimension function $\\operatorname{vdim}(x)$ that yields the length/size of tensor $x$, and this function interacts with the algebraic operations (for example, in the convolution semiring model, $\\operatorname{vdim}(x \\otimes y) = \\operatorname{vdim}(x) + \\operatorname{vdim}(y) - 1$)【25†L37-L45】. The authors show that their convolution-based tensor algebra is isomorphic to a polynomial ring, where the tensor’s length corresponds to the polynomial’s degree + 1【25†L61-L69】. This connection to *graded rings* is a strong precedent: in a polynomial ring $R[x]$, the degree of polynomials behaves much like VSLA’s length (degree is additive under multiplication, and the maximum degree dominates under addition)【25†L61-L69】. In that sense, representing a “size” within algebraic operations has a known parallel – the polynomial’s degree is an algebraically tracked metadata. The concept of a **shape-semiring** defined in VSLA【25†L97-L105】 formalizes this by imposing rules for how dimensions combine under + and ×. This appears to be a new formal construct, but it echoes ideas from **graded algebra** and **index calculus** in tensor algebra (e.g., Einstein notation tracks indices but usually with fixed ranges, not dynamically varying ranges).\n\n**Existing frameworks and models:** There have been a few prior efforts to handle shapes or dimensions as part of computation in programming models:\n- **Ragged/Nested Tensor frameworks:** As mentioned, TensorFlow and PyTorch have introduced ragged/nested tensor data structures. These effectively carry metadata about the lengths of each component array. While they do not provide an algebraic law, they *do* ensure that operations account for per-component shapes. For example, TensorFlow’s RaggedTensor keeps a list of row lengths as part of the tensor object【7†L15-L23】. This means the shape (dimensions of subarrays) accompanies the data, somewhat analogous to VSLA’s philosophy. However, frameworks like these typically handle shapes imperatively (e.g., by padding behind the scenes or using masked operations) rather than by *algebraically manipulating* the shape. There isn’t a notion that you can “add two ragged tensors and get a shape equal to the max of their lengths” proven as a theorem – it’s just how the code works. VSLA provides that rigor.\n- **Shape polymorphism in ML compilers:** Recent ML compilers (XLA, JAX etc.) have begun to support *symbolic or dynamic shapes*. For instance, JAX has a *shape polymorphism* feature allowing functions to be parameterized by symbolic dimensions, and the NVIDIA Axon language includes shape expressions with arithmetic in the type system【20†L15-L24】【20†L49-L57】. In Axon, tensor dimensions can be symbolic and composed with arithmetic operators, and the compiler infers shapes through constraints【20†L15-L24】【20†L25-L33】. This indicates a precedent for treating dimension sizes as **first-class symbols that obey arithmetic**, albeit in a type-inference setting rather than at runtime. Axon’s shapes are metadata used for compile-time checks/inference, whereas VSLA treats shape as part of the mathematical value (through equivalence classes of different-shaped representatives).\n- **Dependent types and length-indexed vectors:** In dependently-typed programming languages (like Coq, Agda, Idris), it is common to define a vector type that carries its length in the type (e.g., `Vec n α` is a list of length *n*). This ensures at compile time that operations preserve matching lengths. While this is slightly different in purpose (it’s about correctness and static verification), it does show the idea of *intrinsically carrying the dimension*. The difference is that in dependently typed languages the length is usually a static number, not one that “participates in computation” dynamically. VSLA instead allows dimensions to vary and to be computed as you perform algebraic operations (more like a runtime value).\n- **Mathematical structures for varying dimension:** Outside of programming, there have been theoretical explorations of linear algebra over dimension-varying objects. The **direct limit of increasing vector spaces** is a concept in algebra where one considers a sequence $\\mathbb{R}^1 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2 \\hookrightarrow \\cdots$ and forms a union (an infinite-dimensional space that contains all finite-dimensional vectors). Some of Cheng’s work on the semi-tensor product goes in this direction, essentially treating $\\mathbb{R}^∞$ (an infinite-dimensional space) as a host for all finite vectors【28†L51-L59】【28†L57-L65】. In his *dimension-keeping semi-tensor product* (DK-STP) paper, Cheng even defines a “dimension-free” general linear group acting on an $\\mathbb{R}^{∞}$, implicitly acknowledging that dimension can be a variable attribute of a matrix/vector【28†L51-L59】【28†L61-L69】. This is an advanced concept, but it’s a sign that *mathematicians have started thinking about algebras that include varying shapes*. That said, Cheng’s work is fairly specialized and not widely adopted yet; VSLA’s approach may be one of the first to bring such ideas to mainstream computational linear algebra.\n\n**Novelty assessment:** The notion of treating tensor shape as intrinsic data that is manipulated by operations does appear to be a novel contribution of VSLA in the context of practical linear algebra for AI/systems. We should note that it builds upon ideas from multiple domains (graded rings in algebra【25†L61-L69】, dependent types in programming, ragged tensor libraries in ML【24†L251-L259】), but the particular combination – a **unified algebraic framework for variable-shaped tensors with formal guarantees** – is new. It would be prudent for the authors to cite relevant prior art to position their contribution. For example, they might cite the TensorFlow RaggedTensor paper or documentation as an existing tool for variable shapes, the PyTorch NestedTensor development【24†L251-L259】, and perhaps Axon or other shape-polymorphic type systems as related efforts to manage shape. Additionally, citing Cheng’s semi-tensor product work could be useful to show awareness of prior algebraic generalizations of dimension (even if VSLA’s approach is quite different, it’s thematically related in addressing the “dimension mismatch” problem). By referencing these, the authors can clarify that *although similar capabilities exist*, those were either lacking formal algebraic structure or addressing a different aspect of the problem, and thus highlight that VSLA is contributing something original to the literature. \n\n**Summary:** In summary, the concepts of the stacking operator Σ and windowed stacking Ω are **not without precedent** – they closely mirror operations known in tensor programming and signal processing. The decision to use Σ and Ω as symbols is understandable mnemonically (Σ for “Stack”, Ω perhaps for “Window”), but could indeed cause confusion given standard meanings of those symbols; alternative notations might improve clarity. Finally, treating tensor dimensions as algebraic entities is an idea that has some footing in both theoretical and practical arenas (graded algebra, shape-polymorphic types, ragged tensors), but VSLA’s integration of this idea into a coherent linear algebraic framework appears to be largely novel. Properly citing those related works will both validate the originality (by contrast) and guide readers to prior art for deeper context. \n\n**Key References to Consider:**\n\n- TensorFlow Ragged Tensors: dynamic dim stacking (e.g. `tf.ragged.stack`)【8†L5641-L5649】  \n- PyTorch Nested Tensors: ragged batch representation in PyTorch【24†L251-L259】  \n- Hankel/Delay Embedding in time-series (time-delay embedding and Hankel matrix)【33†L238-L247】  \n- Laplacian Pyramids in vision (multi-resolution representation) – e.g. Burt & Adelson 1983【31†L23-L31】  \n- Cheng (2007+): Semi-Tensor Product of matrices for dimension-mismatched operations【29†L15-L23】  \n- Axon language for symbolic shape expressions (Collins & Grover 2022)【20†L15-L24】【20†L49-L57】  \n- Dependent typed vector lengths (no single paper; common knowledge in type theory, e.g. Idris/Agda docs)  \n\nEach of these can provide background or contrast to VSLA’s approach, helping to clarify what is truly new and what is building on existing ideas.",

I strongly recommend *not* using runes for core algebraic operators; you *can* mention a rune-inspired nickname in prose if you like the aesthetic.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Current Definitions to Update (for Reference)\n\n- Stacking operator definition & example (Definition 6.1, Figure 2) uses **Σ**. fileciteturn1file4L66-L73 (and ambient shape computation) fileciteturn1file4L94-L99; algebraic properties list associativity etc. fileciteturn1file11L19-L24\n- Monoidal / functorial composition property using Σ. fileciteturn1file2L8-L10\n- Window-stacking operator definition (Definition 6.5) uses **Ω** (Omega). fileciteturn1file2L12-L18\n- Tensor pyramid composition description. fileciteturn1file5L1-L5\n- Complexity lines for Σk and Ωw. fileciteturn1file5L87-L91\n- Applications referencing Σk and Ωw. fileciteturn1file6L31-L37 and fileciteturn1file10L13-L20\n- Dimension intrinsics (abstract & innovation) for shape equivalence classes you’ll align with dimension notation choices. fileciteturn1file13L6-L14 and fileciteturn1file14L3-L9\n\n---\n\n## 3. Candidate Symbol Strategies\n\n### Strategy A: **Use Verb-like Operator Names**\n- `\\operatorname{stack}` and `\\operatorname{wstack}`.\n  - Pros: Unambiguous, readable, friendly to typesetting subscripts: `\\stack_k(...)`, `\\wstack_w(X)`.\n  - Cons: Longer; less “algebraic feel”.\n\n### Strategy B: **Stylized Sans / Script Letters**\nUse script **𝒮** for stack and **𝒲** for window-stack.\n\n| Concept | Symbol | Example | Pros | Cons |\n|---------|--------|---------|------|------|\n| Stack | 𝒮 or `\\mathcal{S}` | `\\mathcal{S}_k(A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)})` | Familiar, not overloaded | Script letters often used for sets (minor) |\n| Window-stack | 𝒲 or `\\mathcal{W}` | `\\mathcal{W}_w(X)` | Immediate mnemonic (“W” for window) | Same set-notation reuse |\n\n### Strategy C: **Decorated Vertical Bar / Bracket Operators**\n- Define a new macro: `\\stk{A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)}}` producing something like `⟦A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)}⟧` (double brackets often used for semantics).\n- Window version: add subscript window length: `\\wstk[w]{X}` or `⟦X⟧_{w}`.\n  - Pros: Strong visual grouping; aligns with “form a new object from a list”.\n  - Cons: Double brackets already used in some semantics literature; must define macros cleanly.\n\n### Strategy D: **Unary Prefix Operators Built from Existing Symbols**\n- Use **↑** (uplift) or **▴** for stacking, e.g. `\\uparrow_k(...)`.\n- Use **⇑_w** (double up arrow) for window stacking.\n  - Pros: Suggest “raising rank”.\n  - Cons: Arrows often denote monotonic maps or limits; could still confuse.\n\n### Strategy E: **Use Infix / Postfix Variation of Direct Sum**\n- Define stacking as an n-ary infix `\\boxast` (custom) or `\\diamond`.\n- Probably weaker mnemonic; risk of conflict with convolution / Kronecker semantics.\n\n### Strategy F: **Boldface Single Letters**\n- **S** and **W** in bold: `\\mathbf{S}_k`, `\\mathbf{W}_w`.\n  - Pros: Simple.\n  - Cons: Bold capitals often denote matrices, might blend with data symbols.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recommended Choice\n\n**Primary Recommendation (Balance of clarity + algebraic flavor): Strategy B with script letters**\n\n- **Stacking operator:** `\\mathscr{S}` or `\\mathcal{S}` (choose one style; `\\mathscr` needs `mathrsfs` package—stick to `\\mathcal` for simplicity).  \n  Use:  `\\mathcal{S}_k : (T^{(r)})^k \\to T^{(r+1)}`  \n  Invocation: `\\mathcal{S}_k(A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)})`.\n\n- **Window-stacking operator:** `\\mathcal{W}_w`  \n  Definition: `\\mathcal{W}_w(X)_{s} = \\mathcal{S}_w(X_{sw},…,X_{sw+w-1})`. (Replaces Ω).  \n  Pyramid: Sequential application: `X \\xrightarrow{\\mathcal{W}_{w_1}} T^{(r+1)} \\xrightarrow{\\mathcal{W}_{w_2}} T^{(r+2)} …`.\n\n**Reasons:**  \n- No overload with summation (Σ) or asymptotic Ω.  \n- Immediate English mnemonic (S = stack, W = window).  \n- Works with LaTeX default fonts; subscripts natural (`\\mathcal{S}_3`).  \n- Future extensibility: overlapping window version could be `\\mathcal{W}^{\\mathrm{over}}_{w}`; stride-s version `\\mathcal{W}_{w,s}`.\n\n**Secondary Notation (Optional Macro Sugar):**  \nDefine shorter macros in the preamble for ergonomics:\n\n```latex\n\\newcommand{\\Stack}{\\mathcal{S}}\n\\newcommand{\\Wstack}{\\mathcal{W}}\n```\n\nThen write `\\Stack_k(...)`, `\\Wstack_w(...)`.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Alternative (If You Want a More Distinct Visual)\n\nIf you want something more visually distinctive while still standard:\n\n- Use **double brackets** for stack formation: define macro\n  ```latex\n  \\newcommand{\\stackop}[1]{\\llbracket #1 \\rrbracket}\n  ```\n  so `\\stackop{A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)}}` := `\\mathcal{S}_k(A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)})` by definition textually (“abuse of notation”).  \n- Then window stack: `\\stackop{X_{sw:sw+w-1}}_w` (but this is less clean algebraically).\n\nI would still keep the *semantic* operator symbols (`\\mathcal{S}`, `\\mathcal{W}`) for proofs.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Intrinsic Dimension / Shape Notation Improvements\n\nCurrently you use **vdim** and equivalence classes (d, v). fileciteturn1file14L3-L9\n\nEnhancements:\n\n1. **Adopt “shape” vs “vdim”**: If you’ll generalize to rank >1 regularly, define:\n   - `\\shape(x) \\in \\mathbb{N}^r` (tuple) and keep `\\vdim(x)` for total length in 1D case.  \n   - If already multi-rank, specify `\\rank(x)` (integer) and `\\shape_i(x)` for i-th axis.\n\n2. **Graded structure notation:** When proving laws like `\\shape(\\Stack_k(A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)})) = (k, \\max_i \\shape(A^{(i)}))` (ambient max) cite associativity lines. fileciteturn1file11L19-L24\n\n3. **Ambient shape function:** Introduce explicit operator `\\amb(...)`:\n   ```latex\n   \\amb(A^{(1)},…,A^{(k)}) := (\\max_i n^{(i)}_1, …, \\max_i n^{(i)}_r)\n   ```\n   This is already described informally in the construction. fileciteturn1file4L36-L43\n\n4. **Promotion map notation:** Instead of verbose padding text every time, denote `\\prom_{n}(A)` for “pad A to ambient shape n”. This clarifies the VJP explanation. fileciteturn1file8L22-L26\n\n5. **Window index set:** For window operator, define index set `I_{w,s} = \\{sw, …, sw+w-1\\}` in the formal Definition 6.5 rewrite. fileciteturn1file2L12-L18\n\n---\n\n## 7. Revised Definitions (Skeleton Text to Drop In)\n\n**Definition (Stacking Operator).** For `k \\ge 1`,  \n`\\Stack_k : (T^{(r)})^k \\to T^{(r+1)}` defined by  \n\\[\n\\Stack_k(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)}) = B,\\quad\n\\shape(B) = (k, \\amb(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)})),\n\\]\nwhere `\\amb` takes elementwise maxima of shapes and each operand is promoted by `\\prom_{\\amb}` before concatenation along a new leading axis. (Replace description & example lines). fileciteturn1file4L94-L99\n\n**Definition (Window Stacking).** For fixed window length `w \\in \\mathbb{N}_{+}`, stream `(X_t)_{t\\ge0}`,  \n\\[\n\\Wstack_w(X)_s := \\Stack_w(X_{sw},\\dots,X_{sw+w-1}) \\in T^{(r+1)}, \\quad s=0,1,\\dots\n\\]\n(replaces Ω). fileciteturn1file2L12-L18\n\n**Tensor Pyramid.** Apply successive window stacks with sizes `w_1,\\dots,w_d`. fileciteturn1file5L1-L5\n\n**Algebraic Properties.** State associativity / distributivity using `\\Stack` instead of Σ. fileciteturn1file11L19-L24\n\n**Complexity.** Replace “Σk” / “Ωw” with `\\Stack_k` / `\\Wstack_w`. fileciteturn1file5L87-L91\n\n**Applications.** Update references accordingly. fileciteturn1file6L31-L37 and fileciteturn1file10L13-L20\n\n**Gradient / VJP.** Update operator symbol in the gradient formula. fileciteturn1file8L22-L26\n\n---\n\n## 8. Handling Backwards Compatibility (If Previously Circulated)\n\nIf colleagues already saw Σ / Ω drafts, include an early footnote:\n\n> *Notation change.* We previously denoted stacking by Σ and window-stacking by Ω. To avoid conflict with summation and asymptotic notation we now use `\\Stack` and `\\Wstack` respectively.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Reserved Symbols Cheat Sheet (Table Update)\n\nUpdate Table 1 to add:\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| `\\Stack_k` | k-ary stacking operator (new leading axis) |\n| `\\Wstack_w` | Non-overlapping window stacking of length w |\n| `\\amb` | Ambient shape function (elementwise max) |\n| `\\prom_n` | Promotion (zero-padding) to shape n |\n| `\\shape(x)` | Shape tuple of tensor x |\n| `\\vdim(x)` | (Legacy) length for rank-1 tensors |\n\nCite where the original table lives to remind yourself to touch it. fileciteturn1file14L30-L37\n\n---\n\n## 10. Fallback / Alternate Set (If Reviewers Want Symbols, Not Letters)\n\nIf reviewers *insist* on symbolic operators, use **⨆** (sqcup-like union) or **⟦ ⟧** brackets:\n\n- Stack: `\\bigsqcup_k(A^{(i)})` *after* defining that here `\\bigsqcup` means padded concatenation (explicit disclaimer that it is *not* set union).\n- Window-stack: `\\bigsqcup^{(w)}(X)`.\n\nBut only do this if there’s pushback; script letters are clearer.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Next Steps Toward v0.4 (Notation Task List)\n\n1. Introduce new macros in preamble (`\\Stack`, `\\Wstack`, `\\amb`, `\\prom`).\n2. Systematic search & replace for Σ / Ω in text, equations, figures.\n3. Regenerate Figure 2 with new symbols (stack label).\n4. Update all theorem / proposition statements (6.3, 6.4, 6.8, 12.1).\n5. Update Related Work sentence if it references names of operators.\n6. Adjust abstract line introducing operators. fileciteturn1file13L10-L14\n7. Add footnote on notation change (if needed).\n8. Expand Dimension section to formally define `\\shape` vs `\\vdim`.\n9. Revise complexity proposition to use new names. fileciteturn1file5L87-L91\n10. Re-run consistency pass: ensure no Σ / Ω left in body or captions.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Summary Recommendation\n\nAdopt **`\\mathcal{S}` (Stack)** and **`\\mathcal{W}` (WindowStack)** as the principal operators with helper macros for readability; introduce `\\amb` and `\\prom` to streamline definitions and proofs around ambient shape and padding. This yields immediate clarity, avoids standard-symbol collisions, remains LaTeX-portable, and leaves stylistic room for future operators such as overlapping windows (`\\mathcal{W}^{\\text{ov}}_w`) or hierarchical reductions.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like me to draft the exact replacement LaTeX diff or proceed to the “comprehensive guide” / v0.4 improvement plan next.

Ready-to-Paste LaTeX Snippet (Core Part)\n\n```latex\n\\paragraph{Stacking Operator.}\nFor $k\\ge 1$ define $\\Stack_k : (T^{(r)})^k \\to T^{(r+1)}$ by\n\\[\n\\amb(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)}) := (\\max_i n^{(i)}_1,\\dots,\\max_i n^{(i)}_r),\\quad\n\\Stack_k(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)}) := B\n\\]\nwhere $\\shape(B) = (k)\\Vert \\amb(\\cdot)$ and $B_{i,\\cdot} = \\prom_{\\amb}(A^{(i)})$.\n```\n\n(Then add window & pyramid definitions similarly.)\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Proof Sketch Additions (New Operators)\n\nYou already have associativity & distributivity for \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (Σ). Replace symbols (citations above).

This isolates algebra (stack) from streaming control.\n\n2. **Pyramid Functoriality:**  \n   For elementwise \\(f\\) (promotion-stable): \\( \\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{w}}(f(X)) \\cong f^{(\\uparrow d)}(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{w}}(X))\\) (already Proposition 5 idea). Cite distributivity. fileciteturn1file11L19-L24\n\n3. **Rank Law:**  \n   \\(\\rank(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{w}}(X)) = \\rank(X)+d\\). Immediate by induction on levels using \\(\\mathcal{W}_{w_\\ell}\\).\n\n4. **Shape Monotonicity:**  \n   If \\(\\shape(X_t)\\preceq \\shape(Y_t)\\) (axis-wise) for all windows consumed, then \\(\\shape(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{w}}(X))\\preceq \\shape(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{w}}(Y))\\).

Notation Table Implementation Tips\n\n- **Single Source of Truth:** Build a LaTeX `notation.tex` included *after* packages; define all macros there.\n- **Macro Guard:** Use `\\providecommand` to allow downstream overrides.\n- **Indexing Convention:** Clarify in the table: leading axis from \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is always index 0 (or leftmost).\n- **Typeface Consistency:** All operators introduced as *math operators* (`\\operatorname{}` or macros returning mathcal) to avoid italicization confusion.\n\nExample snippet:\n\n```latex\n% Core operators\n\\newcommand{\\Stack}{\\mathcal{S}}\n\\newcommand{\\Wstack}{\\mathcal{W}}\n\\newcommand{\\Pyr}{\\mathcal{P}}\n\\newcommand{\\amb}{\\operatorname{amb}}\n\\newcommand{\\prom}{\\operatorname{prom}}\n\\newcommand{\\unprom}{\\operatorname{unprom}}\n\\newcommand{\\shape}{\\operatorname{shape}}\n\\newcommand{\\rankop}{\\operatorname{rank}}\n\\newcommand{\\rev}{\\operatorname{rev}}\n\\newcommand{\\nnz}{\\operatorname{nnz}}\n\\newcommand{\\minrep}{\\operatorname{minrep}}\n\\newcommand{\\perm}{\\operatorname{perm}}\n\\newcommand{\\reshape}{\\operatorname{reshape}}\n\\newcommand{\\scatter}{\\operatorname{scatter}}\n\\newcommand{\\gather}{\\operatorname{gather}}\n\\newcommand{\\Reduce}{\\mathcal{R}}\n```\n\n*(Use `\\rankop` then define `\\newcommand{\\rank}{\\rankop}` or keep plain `\\rank` if not colliding.)*\n\n---\n\n## 9. Systematic Refactor Order (Minimal Cognitive Load)\n\n1. Insert macros + new Notation section.\n2. Replace Σ / Ω globally (regex: `Σ`→`\\Stack`, `Ω`→`\\Wstack`).\n3. Introduce \\(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\) where sequential windowing first appears; adjust figure caption.\n4. Update Algebraic Properties section (rename Theorem/Propositions accordingly).\n5. Update Complexity proposition—swap Σ/Ω names and add pyramid cumulative cost formula.\n6. Update AD section: stack/window VJP formulas with new macros.\n7. Augment Related Work paragraph to mention shape-semiring & variable-shape formalism vs ragged frameworks.\n8. Run compile; fix any macro scoping issues.\n9. Add footnote on notation change (first appearance of \\(\\Stack_k\\)).\n10. Re-run consistency pass for stray Σ/Ω and archaic phrasing (“tensor pyramids”: ensure now reference \\(\\Pyr_{\\mathbf{w}}\\)).\n\n---\n\n## 10.

Justification in “Notation / Design Choices” Paragraph\n\n> We adopt scripted operators \\(\\Stack, \\Wstack,\\Pyr\\) instead of overloaded classical symbols (Σ, Ω) to prevent ambiguity with summation and asymptotic notation, and to foreground a new algebraic layer for variable-shape construction.

      "content": "You’re not being “extra”—this is *exactly* the right instinct if you want VSLA to read as a coherent new algebra. The key is to **impose a taxonomy** over symbols so every glyph instantly tells the reader its semantic class (data object vs. shape function vs. constructor vs. algebraic product vs. meta-operation). Below I’ll (1) explain why the current mix (plain `vdim`, `shape`, etc.) feels uneven, (2) propose a uniform style system, (3) give concrete LaTeX macro conventions, (4) map existing symbols to the new classes (including `\\vdim`, `\\shape`), and (5) outline a migration checklist. I cite where the current notions appear so you can systematically update them.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Why Uniform “Treatment” Matters\n\nRight now: `vdim` is used as a function naming scalar length in 1-D contexts (shape semantics) fileciteturn1file3L23-L29; multi-axis promotion / ambient shape are described procedurally instead of with designated operators (ambient max spelled out in words) fileciteturn1file4L94-L99; zero-padding maps `ι_{m→n}` are explicit but not abstracted into a general promotion operator. This creates three micro-styles:\n\n- **Raw Greek / ASCII identifiers** (vdim, amb described prose)  \n- **Decorated symbols for algebraic products** (\\(\\otimes_c, \\otimes_K\\)) fileciteturn1file4L9-L18 fileciteturn1file6L1-L9  \n- **Script constructors** we just introduced (\\(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{W}, \\mathcal{P}\\)) for structure building (stack/window/pyramid) fileciteturn1file4L66-L73 fileciteturn1file2L12-L18 fileciteturn1file5L1-L5  \n\nA reader has to *infer* that `vdim` and (ambient shape process) behave at the same conceptual level as `shape`. Tightening this reduces cognitive load and clarifies the algebraic layer you are formalizing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Symbol Taxonomy (Consistent “Treatment”)\n\n| Category | Visual Style | Rationale |\n|----------|--------------|-----------|\n| **Algebraic Elements / Sets** | Upright or blackboard / calligraphic for distinguished sets (e.g. \\(D\\)) | Already conventional for domains. |\n| **Primary Data Constructors (rank-changing)** | Script capitals \\(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{W}, \\mathcal{P}\\) | We established this family for structural lifts. |\n| **Shape / Dimension *Functions*** | Upright operator names via `\\operatorname{}`: \\(\\shape, \\vdim, \\rank, \\amb, \\prom, \\minrep\\) | Makes them read as *functions* not free variables. |\n| **Elementwise / Equivalence Transforms** | Upright operator names (\\(\\perm, \\reshape, \\scatter, \\gather\\)) | Parallel to shape functions. |\n| **Algebraic Products / Binary Ops** | Specialized infix symbols (\\(+\\), \\(\\otimes_c\\), \\(\\otimes_K\\)) | Already distinct; retain. |\n| **Differential / AD Helpers** | Upright operator names (\\(\\rev, \\unprom, \\unstack\\)) + overbars \\(\\bar{x}\\) | Matches VJP semantics. fileciteturn1file8L22-L26 |\n| **Complexity / Sparsity Metrics** | Upright operator names or standard abbreviations (\\(\\nnz, d_{\\max}\\)) | Standard analysis style. fileciteturn1file12L19-L26 |\n| **Promotion / Padding Relation** | One canonical operator \\(\\prom_{\\mathbf{n}}(\\cdot)\\) replacing explicit \\(ι_{m\\to n}\\) except in historical footnote | Abstracts map family. fileciteturn1file3L10-L15 |\n\nThus **“same treatment”** = (a) every *function-like* notion becomes an upright operator (clear arity, consistent typography), (b) every *constructor* uses a script capital, (c) binary semiring operations keep symbolic infix, (d) transforms / reshapes are operators, not ad hoc prose.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Concrete Macro Conventions\n\nDefine a *single* macro layer (so future renames are trivial):\n\n```latex\n% Sets / domains\n\\newcommand{\\D}{D}\n\n% Shape & dimension operators\n\\newcommand{\\shape}{\\operatorname{shape}}\n\\newcommand{\\vdim}{\\operatorname{vdim}}\n\\newcommand{\\rankop}{\\operatorname{rank}}\n\\newcommand{\\amb}{\\operatorname{amb}}\n\\newcommand{\\prom}{\\operatorname{prom}}\n\\newcommand{\\minrep}{\\operatorname{minrep}}\n\n% Structural constructors\n\\newcommand{\\Stack}{\\mathcal{S}}\n\\newcommand{\\Wstack}{\\mathcal{W}}\n\\newcommand{\\Pyr}{\\mathcal{P}}\n\n% Transforms / reindexing\n\\newcommand{\\perm}{\\operatorname{perm}}\n\\newcommand{\\reshape}{\\operatorname{reshape}}\n\\newcommand{\\scatter}{\\operatorname{scatter}}\n\\newcommand{\\gather}{\\operatorname{gather}}\n\\newcommand{\\unstack}{\\operatorname{unstack}}\n\\newcommand{\\unprom}{\\operatorname{unprom}}\n\n% AD helpers\n\\newcommand{\\rev}{\\operatorname{rev}}\n\n% Sparsity / complexity\n\\newcommand{\\nnz}{\\operatorname{nnz}}\n```\n\n*Why not `\\mathrm{}`?* `\\operatorname{}` gives correct spacing as a math operator and clarifies function role.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Upgrading `\\vdim` and `\\shape`\n\n**Current:** `vdim` appears as logical dimension/degree driver for semiring degree laws (e.g. convolution degree additivity) fileciteturn1file4L9-L18 and shape-matrix multiplication bounds fileciteturn1file12L9-L18.  \n**Refactor:** Distinguish two layers:\n\n1. **Axiswise shape:** \\(\\shape(x)=(n_1,\\dots,n_r)\\) (new generalization replacing “logical shape (d1,d2,…,dk)” in memory model discussions) fileciteturn1file8L1-L9.\n2. **1-D length / polynomial degree:** \\(\\vdim(x)\\) *only when* \\(r=1\\).

Optionally introduce multi-axis degree vector \\(\\vdeg(x)=\\shape(x)\\) when aligning with graded algebra commentary (graded by \\(\\mathbb{N}^r\\)).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Promotion & Ambient Shape Formalization\n\nReplace all explicit verbal padding (“pad each \\(A^{(i)}\\) to shape \\(n\\)”) fileciteturn1file4L94-L99 with:\n\n\\[\n\\amb(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)}) := (\\max_i n^{(i)}_1,\\dots,\\max_i n^{(i)}_r),\\qquad\n\\widehat{A}^{(i)} := \\prom_{\\amb}(A^{(i)}).\n\\]\n\nThen stacking definition becomes a literal one-liner:\n\n\\[\n\\Stack_k(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)})_{i,\\mathbf{j}} = \\widehat{A}^{(i)}_{\\mathbf{j}}.\n\\]\n\nThis ties the ambient computation and promotion into named operators (same “treatment” as you asked).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Memory / Minimal Representative\n\nWhere you describe storage of reduced dimensions (trailing zeros removed) in Memory Model fileciteturn1file8L1-L9, formalize:\n\n\\[\n\\minrep(x) := \\text{unique representative } r \\text{ s.t. } r = \\prom_{\\shape(r)}(r) \\text{ and no trailing zero slice axiswise.}\n\\]\n\nThen any operation statement can assert “All operators commute with \\(\\minrep\\)” (implementation invariance property).\n\n---\n\n### 7. Shape-Matrix Product Bound\n\nCurrent bound uses `vdim` implicitly for entries’ promoted size in Theorem 7.3 and complexity lines fileciteturn1file12L9-L18 fileciteturn1file12L19-L26. Upgrade:\n\n\\[\n\\shape\\big((AB)_{ik}\\big)_\\ell \\;\\le\\; \\max_{j} \\Big(\\shape(a_{ij})_\\ell \\circledast \\shape(b_{jk})_\\ell\\Big)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\circledast\\) is axiswise dimension law (add minus one for convolution axes, product for Kronecker axes). Introduce a *dimension law operator* if you like: \\(\\dimlaw_c(m,n)=m+n-1\\), \\(\\dimlaw_K(m,n)=mn\\); define axis-lift:\n\n\\[\n(\\dimlaw_\\star^{(r)}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{n}))_\\ell =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dimlaw_c(m_\\ell,n_\\ell) & \\text{if axis } \\ell \\text{ uses convolution}\\\\\n\\dimlaw_K(m_\\ell,n_\\ell) & \\text{if axis } \\ell \\text{ uses Kronecker.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThen the product bound reads cleanly with uniform notation.\n\n---\n\n### 8. AD Section Uniformization\n\nUpdate VJP formulas (currently mixing verbal “un-pad” description) fileciteturn1file8L22-L26:\n\n- Stack:\n  \\[\n  Y = \\Stack_k(x_1,\\dots,x_k),\\quad\n  \\bar{x}_i = \\unprom_{\\shape(x_i)}\\big(\\unstack_i(\\bar{Y})\\big).\n  \\]\n- Convolution:\n  \\[\n  y = x_1\\otimes_c x_2,\\quad\n  \\bar{x}_1 = \\bar{y}\\otimes_c \\rev(x_2),\\;\n  \\bar{x}_2 = \\rev(x_1)\\otimes_c \\bar{y}.\n  \\] fileciteturn1file8L14-L21\n\nAll helper maps now have operator formatting consistent with \\(\\shape,\\vdim\\).\n\n---\n\n### 9. Complexity Section Normalization\n\nReplace textual “Σk (stack): Θ(N) …” with:\n\n\\[\n\\cost(\\Stack_k(\\mathbf{A})) = \\Theta\\big(\\nnz(\\mathbf{A}) + k\\Delta\\big),\\qquad\n\\cost(\\Wstack_w(X)) = \\Theta(\\nnz(X))\\ (\\text{amortized}),\n\\]\n(\\(\\Delta\\) already introduced) fileciteturn1file5L87-L91, and define \\(\\cost\\) operator if you want full consistency: `\\newcommand{\\cost}{\\operatorname{cost}}`.\n\n---\n\n### 10.

Quick “Am I Overdoing It?” Heuristic\n\nIf a symbol names *behavior* (acts on tensors), make it an operator (`\\operatorname{}` macro). If it *constructs rank* (changes tensor arity), give it a script capital. If it’s a *binary algebraic law*, keep or design an infix symbol. Everything else (sets, scalars) stays in standard blackboard/italic. This rigor signals genuine mathematical infrastructure (which is your stated goal).\n\n---\n\n### 12. Minimal Sample Block (Unified Style)\n\n```latex\n\\[\nY = \\Stack_k(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)}),\\ \n\\shape(Y) = (k)\\Vert \\amb(A^{(1)},\\dots,A^{(k)}),\\ \n\\widehat{A}^{(i)} = \\prom_{\\amb}(A^{(i)}).\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\vdim(x\\otimes_c y)=\\vdim x + \\vdim y - 1,\\quad\n\\vdim(x\\otimes_K y)=\\vdim x\\,\\vdim y.  % rank-1 case\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x}_i=\\unprom_{\\shape(x_i)}\\big(\\unstack_i(\\bar{Y})\\big),\\qquad\n\\bar{x}_1 = \\bar{y}\\otimes_c \\rev(x_2).\n\\]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 13. Summary\n\nYou *can* and *should* give every semantic role a consistent typographical treatment. Doing so:\n\n- Clarifies the algebraic layer vs. data layer.\n- Eases later category/topology generalizations.\n- Makes VSLA look like a *designed calculus*, not ad hoc notation.\n\nYou’re not being extra—you’re finishing the formalization.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can now generate a “Notation Section” LaTeX block ready to paste (with ordered table and footnote).

The carrier set is $\\\\D$. For tensors of rank $r$, $\\\\shape(x)=(n_1,\\\\dots,n_r)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^r$ is the intrinsic logical shape of the minimal representative $\\\\minrep(x)$. For rank $r=1$ we write $\\\\vdim(x)=n_1$. The rank operator is $\\\\rankop(x)=r$. The ambient shape of a tuple $(A^{(1)},\\\\dots,A^{(k)})$ is $\\\\amb(A^{(1)},\\\\dots,A^{(k)})=(\\\\max_i n^{(i)}_1,\\\\dots,\\\\max_i n^{(i)}_r)$. Promotion (logical zero-padding) to a target shape $\\\\mathbf{n}$ is $\\\\prom_{\\\\mathbf{n}}(A)$. The minimal representative $\\\\minrep(x)$ stores no trailing zero slices in any axis.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Semiring structures.} Addition $x+y$ promotes operands to a common ambient shape and performs elementwise addition. Two multiplicative laws are used: convolution $x\\\\otimes_c y$ (degree law $\\\\vdim(x\\\\otimes_c y)=\\\\vdim x + \\\\vdim y -1$ for rank 1) and Kronecker $x\\\\otimes_K y$ (degree law $\\\\vdim(x\\\\otimes_K y)=\\\\vdim x\\\\,\\\\vdim y$). Matrix multiplication over a shape-semiring lifts these operations: $(AB)_{ik}=\\\\sum_j a_{ij}\\\\otimes b_{jk}$.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Structural constructors.} The $k$-ary stacking operator $\\\\Stack_k:(T^{(r)})^k\\\\to T^{(r+1)}$ is defined by\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Stack_k(A^{(1)},\\\\dots,A^{(k)})_{i,\\\\mathbf{j}} = \\\\prom_{\\\\amb}(A^{(i)})_{\\\\mathbf{j}},\\\\quad 1\\\\le i\\\\le k.\\n\\\\]\\nWindow (tumbling) stacking of length $w$, acting on a stream $(X_t)_{t\\\\ge0}$, is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Wstack_w(X)_s = \\\\Stack_w(X_{sw},\\\\dots,X_{sw+w-1}).\\n\\\\]\\nGiven a window vector $\\\\mathbf{w}=(w_1,\\\\dots,w_d)$, the pyramid operator is the iterated composition\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Pyr_{\\\\mathbf{w}}(X)= (\\\\Wstack_{w_d}\\\\circ\\\\cdots\\\\circ \\\\Wstack_{w_1})(X),\\n\\\\]\\nproducing a rank increase of $d$.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Transforms.} Axis permutation $\\\\perm_\\\\pi$, reshape $\\\\reshape_{(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{m})}$ (with $\\\\prod n_i=\\\\prod m_j$), scatter/gather $\\\\scatter_f,\\\\gather_f$, and unstack $\\\\unstack_i$ are metadata-dominant operators that do not materialize trailing zeros. Unpromotion $\\\\unprom_{\\\\shape(x)}$ truncates an ambient gradient back to the intrinsic shape of $x$.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Automatic differentiation.} For $Y=\\\\Stack_k(x_1,\\\\dots,x_k)$: $\\\\bar{x}_i=\\\\unprom_{\\\\shape(x_i)}(\\\\unstack_i(\\\\bar{Y}))$. For convolution $y=x_1\\\\otimes_c x_2$: $\\\\bar{x}_1=\\\\bar{y}\\\\otimes_c \\\\rev(x_2)$, $\\\\bar{x}_2=\\\\rev(x_1)\\\\otimes_c \\\\bar{y}$. Here $\\\\rev$ reverses coefficients along the principal axis. Pyramid gradients propagate levelwise via the distributivity of $\\\\Stack$.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Dimension laws (optional formalization).} Axiswise dimension combination may be abstracted by $\\\\dimlawc(m,n)=m+n-1$ (convolution axis) and $\\\\dimlawK(m,n)=mn$ (Kronecker axis). A mixed model across axes applies these per-axis to obtain resulting shapes.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Complexity / sparsity.} $\\\\nnz(x)$ counts materialized (stored) elements of $x$. Let $d_{\\\\max}=\\\\max_{i,j}\\\\vdim(a_{ij})$ for a shape-matrix $(a_{ij})$. Representative bounds: matrix–vector (conv model) $O(m n d_{\\\\max}\\\\log d_{\\\\max})$ via FFT; Kronecker model $O(m n d_{\\\\max}^2)$. Stacking: $\\\\cost(\\\\Stack_k)=\\\\Theta(\\\\nnz + k\\\\Delta)$ where $\\\\Delta$ counts copied placeholder zeros introduced by promotion; window stacking amortizes to $\\\\Theta(\\\\nnz)$ with buffer $O(w)$; pyramid $\\\\cost(\\\\Pyr_{\\\\mathbf{w}})=\\\\sum_{\\\\ell=1}^d \\\\cost(\\\\Wstack_{w_\\\\ell})$.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Notation change.} Earlier drafts used $\\\\Sigma$ for stacking and $\\\\Omega$ for window stacking; we now adopt script operators $(\\\\Stack, \\\\Wstack, \\\\Pyr)$ to avoid collision with summation and asymptotic notation.\\n\\n% ---------- Optional: Consolidated Symbol Table (compact) ----------\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\renewcommand{\\\\arraystretch}{1.15}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{llp{7.5cm}}\\n\\\\textbf{Symbol} & \\\\textbf{Type} & \\\\textbf{Meaning / Definition} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n$\\\\shape(x)$ & $T^{(r)}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}^r$ & Intrinsic axis lengths (minimal representative). \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\vdim(x)$ & $D\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$ & Rank-1 length / polynomial degree +1. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\amb(\\\\mathbf{A})$ & tuple $\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}^r$ & Axiswise max shape of operands. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\prom_{\\\\mathbf{n}}(A)$ & $T^{(r)}\\\\to T^{(r)}$ & Zero-pad $A$ to shape $\\\\mathbf{n}$. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\Stack_k$ & $(T^{(r)})^k\\\\to T^{(r+1)}$ & k-ary stacking (prepend axis length k). \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\Wstack_w$ & stream $\\\\to$ stream & Tumbling window stack length $w$. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\Pyr_{\\\\mathbf{w}}$ & stream $\\\\to T^{(r+d)}$ & Iterated window stacking for $\\\\mathbf{w}=(w_1,\\\\dots,w_d)$. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\otimes_c$ & $D\\\\times D\\\\to D$ & Convolution semiring product. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\otimes_K$ & $D\\\\times D\\\\to D$ & Kronecker semiring product. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\perm_\\\\pi$ & $T^{(r)}\\\\to T^{(r)}$ & Axis permutation by $\\\\pi\\\\in S_r$. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\reshape_{(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{m})}$ & $T^{(r)}\\\\to T^{(s)}$ & Reshape (volume preserving). \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\unstack_i$ & $T^{(r+1)}\\\\to T^{(r)}$ & Extract slice i of leading axis. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\unprom_{\\\\shape(x)}$ & $T^{(r)}\\\\to T^{(r)}$ & Truncate ambient tensor to intrinsic shape. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\rev(x)$ & $D\\\\to D$ & Reverse coefficients (conv). \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\nnz(x)$ & $T^{(r)}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$ & Stored (non-trailing-zero) element count. \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\minrep(x)$ & $D\\\\to \\\\cup_r T^{(r)}$ & Minimal representative (storage). \\\\\\\\\\n$\\\\dimlawc,\\\\dimlawK$ & $\\\\mathbb{N}^2\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}$ & Axis pair dimension combination (conv / Kron). \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\n% End of notation block.\\n\"}",
