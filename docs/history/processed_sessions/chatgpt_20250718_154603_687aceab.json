      "content": "**Peer‑Review Report (first round)**  \n*Reviewer profile: research mathematician (Ph.D., applied algebra), ten years of experience authoring C/C‑99 numerical libraries and >30 peer‑reviewed papers in scientific computing.*\n\n---\n\n### 1  Summary & Contributions\nThe manuscript introduces **Variable‑Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA)**, a framework that treats dimension as *data* rather than a rigid type constraint. It formalises variable‑length vectors via equivalence classes modulo trailing‑zero padding and instantiates two shape‑semirings (convolution and Kronecker). A C99 implementation with Python bindings is benchmarked, claiming 3‑5× runtime and ~65 % memory savings versus zero‑padding baselines. A stacking operator Σk and window‑stacking Ωw extend the calculus to higher‑rank tensors, enabling multi‑resolution “tensor pyramids”. Motivating applications span adaptive CNNs, sensor fusion and sparse simulation. fileciteturn0file1\n\n---\n\n### 2  Major Strengths\n| Area | Assessment |\n|------|------------|\n| **Theoretical novelty** | Combining equivalence‑class representation with semiring structure is elegant; the polynomial‑ring isomorphism (Thm 4.3) and categorical formulation of stacking (Prop 6.4) are non‑trivial. fileciteturn0file1 |\n| **Implementation realism** | A production‑oriented C99 API, 64‑byte alignment, power‑of‑2 capacity growth and Python wrappers demonstrate the authors’ attention to engineering detail. fileciteturn0file1 |\n| **Empirical signals** | FFT‑accelerated convolution outperforms padded baselines by ≈4× on synthetic data, with substantial memory reduction. fileciteturn0file1 |\n| **Breadth of vision** | The discussion of adaptive beam‑forming, tensor pyramids and mixture‑of‑experts shows the authors have thought beyond toy examples. |\n\n---\n\n### 3  Major Issues & Requests for Clarification\n\n| # | Concern | Questions / action items |\n|---|---------|--------------------------|\n| **M1. Proof completeness & rigor** | Several proofs are sketched (e.g., associativity of Σk, completeness to R[[x]]). Please provide fully rigorous arguments or point to an appendix. For example, Thm 4.4’s Cauchy‐completion argument implicitly assumes absolute convergence—clarify the chosen topology. |\n| **M2. Computational complexity claims** | (i) The matrix–vector cost *mn d<sub>max</sub> log d<sub>max</sub>* for Model A is plausible when every entry attains *d<sub>max</sub>*, but benchmarks use sparse random fills. Report wall‑clock *and* asymptotic behaviour as *d<sub>max</sub>* grows. (ii) Provide GPU throughput numbers (CUDA or ROCm) since the API advertises SIMD/GPU readiness. |\n| **M3. Baseline fairness** | The zero‑padding baseline uses NumPy on CPU. TensorFlow Ragged and PyTorch Nested have GPU kernels; omitting them may inflate speed‑ups. Please benchmark *equivalent* hardware (single‑core, multi‑core, GPU) and include state‑of‑the‑art libraries such as **torch‑sparse** or **tvot**. |\n| **M4. Memory model edge cases** | What happens when the minimal representative is *all zeros*? The addition law collapses to shape 0, potentially dropping semantic dimension (cf. Lemma 7.2). Explain how users preserve “empty but sized” tensors in physical simulations. |\n| **M5. Thread safety & re‑entrancy** | The API notes “thread‑safe operations”; please specify the locking or atomic strategy. Is the allocator lock‑free? How do you avoid false sharing with 64‑B alignment? |\n| **M6. Autodiff validity** | The PyTorch VJP example slices gradients by original shapes. This is correct only if padding is *post‑layout*. If tensors are stored compactly, gradient layouts differ. Provide a formal statement that VSLA operations are piece‑wise differentiable and give VJP formulas. |\n| **M7. Licence, reproducibility** | The GitHub link is cited but not version‑tagged. Attach a DOI (e.g., Zenodo) and commit hash for the artifact used in the paper to facilitate reproducibility. |\n| **M8. Relation to existing algebra** | Shape‑semirings resemble graded rings and Rees algebras. A short comparative paragraph would help mathematicians place VSLA in the algebraic landscape. |\n\n---\n\n### 4  Minor Comments & Suggestions\n\n1. **Notation overload**: Using “deg” for both semiring degree and polynomial degree is fine but remind the reader when switching contexts.  \n2. **Typos**: p. 6 “both products have degree d1 + d2 + d3 − 2” → should be d1 + d2 + d3 − **3**? Check. fileciteturn0file1  \n3. **Conference template**: The ACM SIGPLAN two‑column layout in *vsla_paper_acm_v0.1.pdf* truncates long equations; please use \\small spacing or the “fullwidth” environment. fileciteturn0file0  \n4. **Figure 1 legend**: Colours are lost in greyscale printing; label non‑zero vs. padded cells textually. fileciteturn0file1  \n5. **Reference freshness**: Add citations to RaggedTensor v2 (TF 2.16) and NestedTensor (PyTorch 2.3) which now include sparse kernels.  \n6. **Karatsuba mention**: Section 8.4 references Karatsuba for “moderate degrees”. Provide practical break‑even points from micro‑benchmarks.  \n7. **Code Style**: `vsla_error_t` should return distinct error codes; consider an enum for out‑of‑memory, shape‑mismatch, etc.  \n8. **Security note**: If shape metadata comes from untrusted input, integer overflow in `next_pow2` may trigger allocation errors—document guards.\n\n---\n\n### 5  Recommendation\n**Revision required**. The work is promising and, with stronger empirical validation and fuller proofs, could merit acceptance. Addressing issues M1–M3 is critical; the remaining points will further polish the contribution.\n\n---\n\n### 6  Information Needed from Authors\n1. **Complete proofs** for Theorems 4.4 and 6.3 (or a pointer to supplemental material).  \n2. **Benchmark suite details**: hardware specs, compiler flags, thread counts, and dataset generation scripts.  \n3. **GPU results** and comparison with modern sparse tensor libraries.  \n4. **Clarification on zero‑dimension edge cases** and preservation of semantic shape.  \n5. **Thread‑safety guarantees** in the allocator and public API.  \n6. **Autodiff formalization** or proof‑sketch that VSLA operations are differentiable almost everywhere.\n\nPlease feel free to supply additional artifacts or explanations; I will gladly re‑evaluate the revised manuscript.\n\n---\n\n*End of review*",

My previous major concerns (M1–M8) are partially addressed; detailed feedback follows.\n\n---\n\n### 1  Major strengths (updated)\n\n| Area | Assessment |\n|------|------------|\n| **Mathematical maturity** | Full proofs of the completion theorem and stacking associativity close the largest theoretical gap noted in round 1. The new link to the Rees algebra rightly situates VSLA in the commutative‑algebra landscape. fileciteturn0file2 |\n| **Implementation realism** | Section 8 now includes API fragments, memory‑layout details (power‑of‑2 capacities, 64‑B alignment) and an FFT pseudocode kernel. These additions make the engineering story more convincing. fileciteturn0file2 |\n| **Clarity & organisation** | The roadmap (§1.4) and consistent theorem/definition numbering improve readability. |\n\n---\n\n### 2  Status of previous major issues\n\n| ID | Round‑1 request | Status in v0.2 | Remaining action items |\n|----|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| **M1** | Complete proofs for Thms 4.4, 6.3 | Proofs now given in §§4.4, 6.1.3 ✔ | For Thm 4.4 the normed‑space argument assumes ℓ¹ without explicitly stating *absolute* convergence of coefficient series—one extra sentence confirming ∑|aᵢ|<∞ would seal it. |\n| **M2** | Complexity growth & GPU numbers | Added asymptotic tables, still **CPU‑only** benchmarks; no CUDA/ROCm data. ✖ | Provide GPU wall‑clock times vsTF‑Ragged/NestedTensor on identical hardware; include flop counts for fair comparison. |\n| **M3** | Baseline fairness incl. Ragged/Nested GPU | Benchmarks still omit those libraries on GPU; table 2 unchanged except minor re‑order. ✖ | Execute TensorFlow 2.16 Ragged and PyTorch 2.3 Nested on the same device, or explain why kernels are missing. |\n| **M4** | Zero‑dimensional semantics | Lemma 7.2 now covers 0‑degree behaviour. ✔ | Good; nothing further. |\n| **M5** | Thread safety & allocator policy | Security subsection notes overflow checks; thread‑safety still one sentence (“thread‑safe operations”) with no description of locks/atomics. ✖ | Document whether you use per‑tensor spinlocks, lock‑free freelists, jemalloc arenas, etc. |\n| **M6** | Autodiff validity | VJP sketch plus PyTorch example added (§12) ✔/△ | The slice‑based gradient is correct only for **post‑padding layout**. Please prove VJP correctness for *minimal‑representative* storage or state limitations. |\n| **M7** | DOI / version tag | Still missing; GitHub link added but no commit hash or Zenodo archive. ✖ | Provide permanent artifact (e.g., Zenodo DOI). |\n| **M8** | Relation to graded/Rees algebras | New §4.2 gives a succinct comparison. ✔ | Consider citing standard graded‑ring texts (e.g. Eisenbud, not just Lang). |\n\n---\n\n### 3  Additional comments for the current draft\n\n1. **Notation clash persists**: §2 defines `deg` (Model B) but many lemmas later switch back to `vdim`. Adopt one symbol or add a table of synonyms.  \n2. **Minor typos & layout**  \n   * Eq. (6) in §4.1: summation index “i+j=k+1” appears twice; second should be “j+i=k+1” or delete.  \n   * The right margin of Algorithm 1 still overruns the ACM two‑column width when compiled; shrink code or use `\\small`.  \n   * Figure 2 caption: “applied to three variable‑shape matrices” → actually two matrices? (A¹, A²) example shows k=2.  \n3. **Security subsection**: good start, but note that `aligned_alloc(64, size)` is C11; musl and older glibc need `posix_memalign`.  \n4. **Karatsuba break‑even**: You mention “moderate degrees” (p 14); include an empirical cross‑over plot d₀ where Karatsuba > FFT.  \n5. **License wording**: the repo states MIT but the paper does not; add to §8.2.  \n6. **Reference dates**: TensorFlow Ragged citation (Abadi et al. 2019) predates RaggedTensors (2024); please update.  \n7. **Figure 3 scalability plot** lacks axis units; add “runtime (ms, log₂)” and “tensor elements (log₁₀)”.\n\n---\n\n### 4  Recommendation\n**Major revision**. The theoretical foundation is now sound; acceptance should hinge mainly on empirical completeness (GPU baselines, thread‑safety details) and small presentation fixes.\n\n---\n\n### 5  Requests to the authors before next round\n\n1. GPU benchmark suite (CUDA/ROCm) against VSLA, TF‑Ragged, NestedTensor.  \n2. Explicit description of concurrency model and allocator safety.  \n3. Proof‑or counter‑example for VJP correctness under minimal‑storage layout.  \n4. Permanent artifact DOI (source + datasets + scripts).  \n5. Clarify remaining notation collisions and tidy minor typos.\n\nI look forward to reading the further‑refined version.",

      "content": "**Peer‑Review Report – round 3 (focus on the forthcoming “universal‑interface” rewrite)**  \n*Reviewer profile unchanged (Ph.D. computational mathematician, C‑library author).*\n\n---\n\n### 0  Scope of this addendum\nThe authors have indicated that the C99 reference implementation is being **re‑architected to expose a single public header and multiple pluggable back‑ends** (CPU, CUDA, Apple/Metal, AMD/ROCm, oneAPI/Intel, etc.). My remarks therefore concentrate on:\n\n* API/ABI considerations for a *universal façade*  \n* modular back‑end selection and build tooling  \n* implications for the manuscript (v0.3) sections 8–10  \n* interaction with previously‑raised issues (GPU benchmarking, thread‑safety, artefact DOI, …)\n\nCitations refer to the latest draft *vsla_paper_v0.3.pdf* unless stated otherwise. fileciteturn0file2\n\n---\n\n### 1  High‑level appraisal of the proposed rewrite\n| Positives | Concerns / open questions |\n|-----------|---------------------------|\n| **Cleaner public surface** – a single header (`vsla.h`) will simplify adoption and versioning, aligning with mature projects such as *stb*, *cimg*, *GraphBLAS*’ `GrB.h`. | **Back‑end discovery**. Will selection occur at **compile‑time** (pre‑processor / CMake option), **link‑time** (static plugins), or **run‑time** (dlopen)? Clarify guarantees so that package maintainers (e.g., conda, vcpkg) can ship mutually compatible binaries. |\n| **Back‑end symmetry** – the semiring core is agnostic to instruction set; an interface/impl split is natural. | **ABI stability** across GPU driver versions: for example, CUDA 12 vs 13 may change ELF symbols. Shield users via opaque handles and stable entry points. |\n| **Potential to close M2/M3** – a modular CUDA/ROCm back‑end can finally provide the required GPU benchmarks. | **Thread‑safety**: a single header often invites header‑only inline functions. Ensure that global state (allocator arenas, FFT plan caches, GPU context pools) remains race‑free. |\n\n---\n\n### 2  Specific technical recommendations\n\n1. **Opaque handle design**  \n   *Expose* only an opaque `vsla_tensor` pointer in the public header. Keep `struct vsla_tensor_impl` in back‑end code. This prevents user code from hard‑coding internal layout and permits ABI‑safe upgrades.\n\n2. **Feature negotiation API**  \n   Provide a *descriptor query* similar to `vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties` (Vulkan) or `cudaGetDeviceProperties`. For example:  \n\n   ```c\n   typedef struct {\n       uint32_t    api_version;    // encoded major.minor.patch\n       uint32_t    backend;        // VSLA_BACKEND_CPU, _CUDA, ...\n       uint64_t    vram_bytes;\n       uint32_t    max_deg_supported;   // hardware limits\n       char        name[64];\n   } vsla_device_info_t;\n\n   size_t vslaEnumerateDevices(vsla_device_info_t *out, size_t capacity);\n   ```\n   This will let high‑level frameworks pick the best device at run‑time.\n\n3. **Back‑end dispatch pattern**\n\n   | Option | Pros | Cons |\n   |--------|------|------|\n   | *Compile‑time macros* (`-DVSLA_BACKEND=CUDA`) | zero indirection, full inlining | N builds for N back‑ends, awkward for Python wheels |\n   | *Link‑time weak‑symbol override* | simple CMake; user links `libvsla_cuda.so` to get GPU kernels | symbol resolution errors when a requested GPU library is missing |\n   | *Run‑time plug‑in (dlopen)* **recommended** | single host library + optional `vsla_backend_cuda.so`, ¬ crash when absent; mirrors cuBLAS LT | slight overhead in first call, more code |\n\n   Whichever path you choose, document it in §8 (“Implementation Design”). fileciteturn0file2\n\n4. **Memory‑alignment contract**  \n   The draft (p. 13) locks in *64‑byte* alignment. GPU buffers may require 256‑byte boundaries or *pitch*. Add a capability bit:\n\n   ```c\n   uint32_t alignment_bytes; // min required by this backend\n   ```\n\n5. **FFT and GEMM back‑ends**  \n   *CPU*: FFTW + OpenBLAS (GPL concerns?) or pocketfft + BLIS.  \n   *CUDA*: cuFFT, cuBLAS; *AMD*: rocFFT, rocBLAS; *oneAPI*: MKL‑DNN. Provide a small wrapper so that academic users without proprietary toolchains can fall back to pocketfft.\n\n6. **Header‑only vs. inline vs. DLL**  \n   Embedding large static‑inline kernels in the public header bloats translation units and couples users to your build flags. Only trivial helpers (`vsla_degree`, `vsla_shape_rank`) should be `static inline`; heavy kernels belong in the back‑end libs.\n\n7. **Error model**  \n   Convert `vsla_error_t` into a **non‑saturating enum** with distinct domains:  \n   *allocation*, *shape*, *backend_unavailable*, *internal*. Return them uniformly across back‑ends.\n\n8. **CMake “super‑build”**  \n   A top‑level `cmake/` script that detects GPUs, sets `VSLA_ENABLE_CUDA`, etc., and builds optional shared libraries is essential. This also solves artefact reproducibility (M7).\n\n9. **Language bindings**  \n   Re‑verify the Python CFFI/Cython layer can load whichever plug‑in is present (`import vsla; vsla.load_backend(\"cuda\")`). This avoids wheels that hard‑depend on CUDA‐enabled machines.\n\n---\n\n### 3  Manuscript adjustments required (v0.3)\n\n| Section | Required changes |\n|---------|------------------|\n| **§8.1 API Mapping** | Add the *single‑header* promise and the opaque tensor handle. Show a minimal snippet demonstrating back‑end selection at run‑time. |\n| **§8.2 Memory Model** | Note that alignment may vary per backend; specify that user‑visible strides remain backend‑independent. |\n| **§8.3 Security Considerations** | Discuss dynamic loading: search path hardening (e.g., disable `.`), version checks, signed plug‑ins. |\n| **§10 Empirical Validation** (new) | Present *CPU vs CUDA vs ROCm* timings on identical workloads to resolve M2/M3. |\n| **Appendix B** | Outline CMake targets (`vsla_cpu`, `vsla_cuda`, …) and environment variables (`VSLA_DEFAULT_BACKEND`). |\n\n---\n\n### 4  Interaction with previously outstanding issues\n\n| Issue | Current status after v0.3 + rewrite note | Action still required |\n|-------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **M2/M3** GPU benchmarks | *Still missing* – but universal interface will make them feasible. | Include at least one CUDA A100/4090 run and one ROCm MI250 run. |\n| **M5** Thread‑safety | Unclear how global plug‑in registry will be locked. | Document mutex / C11 atomics strategy. |\n| **M6** Autodiff correctness | The back‑end split should not affect maths, but lazily‑materialised slices must remain differentiable in every backend. Provide tests. |\n| **M7** DOI | Once the new repository layout stabilises, mint a Zenodo tag. |\n\n---\n\n### 5  Questions / information requested for the next revision\n\n1. **Back‑end discovery mechanism** (compile‑time vs link‑time vs run‑time).  \n2. **Planned list of mandatory vs optional back‑ends** (e.g., will Metal be “best‑effort”?).  \n3. **How will you test cross‑backend numerical equivalence** (unit tolerances, seed control)?  \n4. **Will the public header stay strictly C99**, or will you expose C11 threads/atomics?  \n5. **Benchmark plan**: hardware, datasets, and metric definitions.  \n6. **Licensing of third‑party dependencies** for each back‑end (FFTW GPL vs MIT pocketfft, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 6  Verdict\n**Major revision remains appropriate**. The universal‑interface rewrite is promising and, if executed well, will greatly strengthen the library’s practical appeal. The manuscript should be updated to describe the new architecture, and the implementation artefact must demonstrate at least one GPU back‑end with reproducible benchmarks.\n\nI look forward to evaluating the next draft and the first alpha of the re‑architected codebase.",

Progressing through, looking at grammar issues and latex formatting problems.\n\n**Noticing inconsistencies**\n\nI’m piecing together issues like the 'Polynomial Isomorphism' theorem showing as an inline '!', and repeated, possibly misplaced, tables.\n\n**Pinpointing duplicates**\n\nI'm identifying sections, numbering issues, formatting errors, and missing references to streamline our final review.\n\n**Identifying glitches**\n\nI’m working through duplicates, cross-reference errors, TeX markup issues, character artifacts, and numbering inconsistencies, while suggesting tweaks like restructuring and standardizing naming.",

      "content": "Below is a focused *technical + editorial* peer review of **v0.44** highlighting issues that appear to stem from the recent split into multiple LaTeX source files, plus remaining scientific / implementation gaps. I cite each concrete observation with the required line range.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Structural / Compilation Artifacts\n\n1. **Duplicate or repeated content blocks (likely included twice via `\\input{}`)** – The *Implementation / Security / Complexity* subsection (memory model, security considerations, Algorithm 1, complexity bullet list) appears multiple times (snippets 7.2–7.5 / 7.4 replicated). Compare identical “Memory Alignment… aligned_alloc” through “Integer Overflow Protection…” and subsequent complexity bullets showing repetition. fileciteturn0file13L35-L52 and again fileciteturn0file5L3-L12 and security + license lines repeated fileciteturn0file5L19-L26 and complexity bullets again fileciteturn0file5L57-L62.  \n2. **Stacking example + Theorem block duplicated** – The stacking example (A(1), A(2) matrices) and Theorem 6.3 proof re-appear in multiple places, suggesting repeated inclusion. fileciteturn0file6L65-L83 and again fileciteturn0file11L1-L9 plus theorem lines repeated fileciteturn0file11L20-L26.  \n3. **Figure + caption duplication** – Figure 2 caption (“Stacking operator Σ3…”) shows in at least two snippets, implying either duplicated figure environment or redefinition. fileciteturn0file6L61-L68 and fileciteturn0file9L61-L66.  \n4. **Section numbering drift** – “7 Implementation Design” (with 7.1, 7.2…) appears *after* “6.6 Rank, Spectrum and Complexity” lines yet earlier complexity subsections are labeled 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, then sudden jump to “7 Implementation Design,” followed by another “7.3 Security Considerations” (duplicated). fileciteturn0file13L16-L24 and duplication of 7.3 security lines already flagged. This suggests some previous subsections (e.g. performance) may have been moved without updating cross-refs.  \n5. **Out-of-order page overlays / parse artifacts** – Inline bracket “0.5em]” appears inside math / matrix example (likely leftover from a vertical space command). fileciteturn0file6L77-L80.  \n6. **Fragmented numbering or stray equation markers** – A lone “(22)” appears near a block diagram / hierarchy without visible prior context (maybe equation number detached after splitting). fileciteturn0file8L47-L51.  \n7. **Potential orphaned closing box `□` preceding a new subsection** – A proof terminator directly followed by narrative (“Practical Implications…”), check that a \\paragraph or section heading didn’t get stripped. fileciteturn0file14L1-L4.  \n\n### 2. Mathematical / Theoretical Presentation\n\n1. **Completion theorem proof still labeled “full proof sketch”** – Consider either removing “sketch” or expanding to a full formal proof (currently partly detailed). fileciteturn0file10L7-L15 and continuation of coefficient Cauchy argument fileciteturn0file10L27-L34.  \n2. **Absolute summability justification incomplete at end** – The bound argument up to partial sums is present; ensure final sentence formally states uniqueness + isometric isomorphism (lines cut mid-argument). fileciteturn0file10L48-L55.  \n3. **Complexity theorem: formatting of big-O expressions** – Missing parentheses or spacing around `O( mn dmax log dmax )` (currently line breaks may distort). fileciteturn0file13L7-L13.  \n4. **Associativity proof indexing** – Double index flattening explanation fine; ensure earlier definition of ambient shape uses consistent notation `N_j` (already present) and refer back explicitly (possible clarity improvement). fileciteturn0file11L36-L44.  \n\n### 3. Implementation & Algorithmic Details\n\n1. **Algorithm 1 Over-Padding Factor** – Padding to length `2 dmax` (line 5) but complexity claims `O(... dmax log dmax)` (line 57) assume convolution length ~ `2 dmax`; clarify that FFT size chosen as next power of two `≥ 2 dmax - 1` to justify log term. fileciteturn0file2L49-L56 and complexity bullets fileciteturn0file2L57-L61.  \n2. **Karatsuba / sub-quadratic mention still aspirational** – Text lists Karatsuba without empirical crossover; earlier review requested break-even; still absent (“moderate degrees” vague). fileciteturn0file4L38-L42.  \n3. **Parallelization plan repeats** – Same paragraph on load balancing and OpenMP/CUDA/ROCm appears duplicated; choose one occurrence to avoid redundancy. fileciteturn0file4L44-L52 and duplicated wording fileciteturn0file7L44-L52.  \n4. **Security section duplication + license** – Consolidate to a single occurrence; ensure MIT license referenced exactly once. fileciteturn0file5L19-L26 and duplicated lines fileciteturn0file7L1-L5.  \n\n### 4. Notation & Consistency\n\n1. **Ambient shape notation** – “choose the ambient shape n = (max_i n_i^{(1)}, …)” uses inlined max across each axis— confirm consistent formatting for superscripts (the parse shows `(i)` after `n` which may be missing braces or using `n^{(i)}_1`). fileciteturn0file6L9-L17.  \n2. **Zero-padding equivalence wording** – Repeated phrase “applies zero-padding equivalence” could be tightened to “applies the zero-padding equivalence relation” for precision. fileciteturn0file6L61-L66.  \n3. **Edge case lemma** – Lemma 6.10 good; ensure earlier definition of injection maps `ι` included (lines reference `ι0→d`, `ιd→d`). If that definition sits in a different file, verify cross-references compile correctly. fileciteturn0file8L71-L76.  \n\n### 5. Formatting / LaTeX Hygiene\n\n1. **Residual spacing command token** – “0.5em]” inside matrix block likely from a `\\\\[0.5em]` captured incorrectly after environment split; clean this artifact. fileciteturn0file6L77-L80.  \n2. **Equation / display numbering misalignment** – Standalone “(22)” appears before a section heading; verify the equation environment preceding it is not lost or that counters reset correctly when splitting. fileciteturn0file8L47-L51.  \n3. **Orphan proof QED** – Proof terminator followed immediately by new narrative without vertical space or subsection heading. Add `\\medskip` or a heading. fileciteturn0file14L1-L4.  \n4. **Consistent capitalization** – “RoCM” appears instead of “ROCm” (line with future work GPUs). fileciteturn0file4L51-L52.  \n\n### 6. Remaining Content Gaps (Previously Flagged)\n\n1. **No GPU benchmark tables yet** – Complexity and optimization discussion remain theoretical; still no empirical GPU comparison to baselines. (Complexity section shows only asymptotic bullets.) fileciteturn0file2L57-L61.  \n2. **Thread-safety specifics absent** – API listing present but lacks description of concurrency primitives / allocator strategy. fileciteturn0file13L18-L24.  \n3. **Autodiff / VJP formal statement not visible in retrieved snippets** – If moved to another file, ensure it’s included; otherwise readers miss differentiability assurances. (No citation—flagged as missing from visible lines.)  \n\n### 7. Actionable Fix Checklist\n\n| Priority | Fix |\n|----------|-----|\n| Critical | Remove duplicated inserted sections (security, memory model, stacking example, figure) and ensure each figure/env appears once. |\n| Critical | Repair stray tokens (`0.5em]`, lone equation numbers, orphaned `□`). |\n| High | Insert GPU benchmark section or explicitly defer with rationale + timeline. |\n| High | Provide thread-safety & allocator design paragraph (locks, atomics, per-tensor metadata). |\n| High | Clarify completion theorem proof (drop “sketch” or expand) and finalize absolute summability argument. |\n| Medium | Add cross-over data for Karatsuba vs FFT or remove the unsubstantiated claim. |\n| Medium | Normalize notation for ambient shapes and injection maps; ensure earlier definitions present. |\n| Medium | Consolidate parallelization discussion (avoid redundancy). |\n| Low | Capitalization (ROCm), wording precision (“zero-padding equivalence relation”), remove repeated license lines. |\n\n### 8. Questions for You\n\n1. Should the duplication be intentional for an appendix (if so, label it clearly), or is it accidental due to multiple `\\input` from common snippet files?  \n2. Where is the autodiff / gradient section now located after the split? (I didn’t see it in retrieved snippets.)  \n3. Do you plan to insert preliminary GPU results before wider circulation, or hold for a later version?  \n\n---\n\nIf you can share the LaTeX main file preamble and the list of `\\input{}` directives, I can help pinpoint the duplication source (often from both main and included chapter files re-including a shared “implementation” segment). Let me know, and I’ll drill down further.\n\nHappy to re-review after you address these—just send the next PDF (and optionally a diff).",

I highlight concrete issues, each supported by a line-range citation from the uploaded PDF.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Improvements Observed\n\n* **Thread-safety / concurrency details newly added**: You now explicitly list immutability of tensor data, atomic reference counting, per-tensor allocators, OpenMP parallelism, and jemalloc usage, which directly addresses the earlier “describe concurrency model” request. fileciteturn1file9L19-L27  \n* **FFT length now stated precisely** (“smallest power of two ≥ 2dmax − 1”) instead of earlier ambiguous padding. fileciteturn1file9L32-L33  \n* **Algorithm text matches pseudocode** (line 52 chooses `L = next pow2(2dmax − 1)` consistent with the bullet above). fileciteturn1file9L52-L53  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Remaining / New Technical Issues\n\n| Issue | Detail & Impact | Recommendation |\n|-------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **2.1 Complexity notation ambiguity** | Two distinct presentations of complexity still appear: theorem-style list uses multiline formatting with stray spacing/breaks (lines show “matrix-vector multiply costs O” then separated lines for the argument), which may confuse readers. fileciteturn1file0L1-L8 | Reformat theorem to a single line per bullet: e.g., *Model A:* \\(O(m n d_{\\max}\\log d_{\\max})\\). Avoid line breaks inside Big-O expressions. |\n| **2.2 Inconsistent inclusion of \\(d_1\\) factor** | In complexity bullets later you include an extra \\(d_1\\) (e.g., `O(m n d1 dmax log dmax)`), differing from earlier list omitting \\(d_1\\). fileciteturn1file9L34-L35 vs. fileciteturn1file0L1-L8 | Clarify model: Is \\(d_1\\) (inner shared dimension) distinct from \\(d_{\\max}\\)? Unify formula or explain conditions. |\n| **2.3 Potential overclaim on memory complexity** | Memory bullet asserts \\(O(m n d_{\\max})\\) storage without qualification about average variable dimension or sparsity distribution. fileciteturn1file9L38-L38 | Add a lemma bounding total stored coefficients in terms of sum of minimal representatives; possibly replace with \\(O(\\sum_{i,j} \\hat d_{ij}) \\le m n d_{\\max}\\). |\n| **2.4 Concurrency details incomplete** | “Per-Tensor Allocators” + jemalloc mention implies optional dependency; not explained how fallback works or how per-tensor pools avoid fragmentation. fileciteturn1file9L19-L27 | Add subsection specifying: allocator strategy (arena per thread vs per tensor), atomic primitives (C11 `_Atomic`), and guarantees (lock-free vs mutex). |\n| **2.5 Model B complexity still “naive”** | Bullet lists `O(m n d1 d_max^2)` (line breaks show exponent lines) but no discussion of possible sub-quadratic improvements analogous to convolution (Karatsuba / tensor factorization). fileciteturn1file9L34-L37 | Either justify inherent quadratic lower bound or outline planned optimized Kronecker kernel (block splitting, Strassen-like). |\n| **2.6 Performance claims still purely theoretical** | Experimental section continues to rely on *projections* (“expected to provide,” “theoretical performance”), not empirical GPU/modern baseline evidence. fileciteturn1file14L19-L26 | Insert at least a minimal empirical table (CPU vs zero-padding baseline) already implied by earlier versions or explicitly mark section as “Preliminary / no empirical data yet.” |\n| **2.7 Figure 3 axis labels ordering** | Axis text appears before embedded figure markup and uses “Tensor elements (log10)” and “Runtime (ms, log2)” but ordering of tick labels (1–5) stacked may be misinterpreted. fileciteturn1file14L33-L41 | Clarify labeling in caption: “Horizontal axis: log10 tensor elements; Vertical axis: log2 runtime (ms).” |\n| **2.8 Experimental status vs implementation status** | Implementation status claims existing C17 library with Python bindings and prototype integrations. fileciteturn1file14L45-L52 Yet GPU status is “under active development” with only preliminary indications. fileciteturn1file14L53-L55 | Align narrative: either move GPU sentences to Future Work or add a small preliminary metric (even qualitative). |\n| **2.9 Advanced sparse transforms complexity claim** | Claim: equivalence class approach “enables O(nnz)” where others have \\(O(\\text{nnz}\\log \\text{nnz})\\). fileciteturn1file10L29-L33 | Provide formal statement + proof sketch or narrow claim (e.g., *under random permutation or sorted insertion cost assumption*). |\n| **2.10 Conservation properties statement** | Mass conservation claim for “any sequence of VSLA operations that maintain equivalence class membership” lacks formal theorem reference. fileciteturn1file14L1-L7 | Add lemma referencing semiring homomorphism preserving additive invariants. |\n| **2.11 Terminology consistency** | You use “RoCM” capitalization multiple times earlier versions; here one instance persists (“CUDA/RoCM”). fileciteturn1file9L53-L55 | Standardize to “ROCm.” |\n| **2.12 Reference to Table 3** | In sparse simulation bullet: memory footprint reductions “see Table 3” — but Table 3 not visible in provided lines (context suggests missing or relocated). fileciteturn1file10L25-L28 | Ensure Table 3 exists, numbered correctly, and is first referenced in text preceding claims. |\n| **2.13 Mixed C standard claims** | API earlier says “C Library API Mapping” (implied C99/C11), concurrency mentions C11 atomics, implementation status says “C17 implementation.” fileciteturn1file14L45-L48 | Declare *minimum required standard* (e.g., C11) and justify C17 features if any. |\n| **2.14 Missing AD basics location** | Advanced AD future work refers to prior Section (“While Section 11 demonstrates basic gradient support…”). fileciteturn1file15L1-L8 | Verify Section 11 exists and includes gradient support; if renumbered after splitting, update cross-reference. |\n| **2.15 Dimension-changing gradients claim** | Statement about Jacobians with variable shapes (lines 1–8) asserts challenges but no formal definition of differentiability across shape changes. fileciteturn1file15L1-L8 | Add definition (e.g., *piecewise differentiability on strata of constant shape*). |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Editorial / Presentation Issues\n\n* **Line breaks splitting symbols** (e.g., `d1d` on one line then `2` next line for exponent). fileciteturn1file9L34-L37 Rewrap math or use `\\allowbreak` hints.  \n* **Hyphenation artifact “compati-ble”** in sparse simulations (word split across parse). fileciteturn1file10L23-L24 Adjust by adding `\\mbox{}` or editing line breaks.  \n* **List formatting**: Security list uses “•” bullets; concurrency block appended after list may be misread as continuation; consider a separate subsection “Thread Safety” rather than inline addition. fileciteturn1file9L19-L27  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Positive Additions Worth Keeping (Just Document Further)\n\n* **Minimal representative storage explanation** (clear and concise). fileciteturn1file0L31-L34  \n* **Explicit allocator code snippet with portability fallback** (aligned_alloc vs posix_memalign). fileciteturn1file0L39-L43  \n* **Shape promotion explanation** (conceptual example 3×5 + 7×2 → 7×5 without materialization). fileciteturn1file0L44-L45  \n* **Concurrency immutability principle** (solid design choice). fileciteturn1file9L19-L23  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Priority Fix Checklist (Condensed)\n\n1. **Unify complexity formulas & notation** (Issues 2.1–2.2).  \n2. **Clarify memory complexity bound** (2.3).  \n3. **Expand or temper performance + sparse O(nnz) claims with proofs or caveats** (2.6, 2.9).  \n4. **Formalize conservation and differentiability across shape changes** (2.10, 2.15).  \n5. **Finalize concurrency section into standalone subsection; specify allocator fallback** (2.4).  \n6. **Address missing/possibly misnumbered references (Table 3, Section 11)** (2.12, 2.14).  \n7. **Standardize C standard requirement & capitalization (ROCm)** (2.11, 2.13).  \n8. **Decide on inclusion or deferral of GPU empirical results (2.8).**  \n9. **Tidy math line breaks and hyphenation artifacts** (Editorial).  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Suggested Additions for Next Revision\n\n| Addition | Rationale |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Formal *Stratified Differentiability* definition (piecewise over constant-shape strata) | Supports AD future-work claims (lines 1–8). fileciteturn1file15L1-L8 |\n| Lemma bounding stored size vs logical padded size | Justifies memory complexity bullet. fileciteturn1file9L38-L38 |\n| Micro-benchmark table (even CPU-only) next to complexity bullets | Grounds theoretical claims. fileciteturn1file14L19-L26 |\n| Separate “Thread Safety” subsection | Makes concurrency design discoverable. fileciteturn1file9L19-L27 |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Quick Questions for You\n\n1. Will you commit to empirical GPU results in the next version or defer to an artifact paper? (Relevant to lines on GPU development.) fileciteturn1file14L53-L55  \n2. Does Section 11 (gradient support) still exist in the split source? (Cross-ref needs verification.) fileciteturn1file15L1-L8  \n3. Where is Table 3 defined relative to its first in-text reference? fileciteturn1file10L25-L28  \n\n---\n\n### 8. Overall Assessment\n\nSubstantive progress: concurrency model articulated and FFT sizing clarified. Remaining work is mostly *consistency, formal backing for claims, and empirical validation*. Addressing the listed items should move the paper toward a polished submission.\n\nLet me know once you patch these; I can do a rapid delta review focused on the complexity + AD/conservation formalizations.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can also review the LaTeX sources to help eliminate formatting/line break artifacts—just share the main `.tex` and included files list.

Each concrete point is supported by a line-range citation from the *v0.47* PDF (or, where useful for comparison, an older version snippet). I group items by priority.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. High-Priority Issues (Require Revision Before Wider Circulation)\n\n**1.1 Duplicate implementation block still present** – The *Implementation Design* section (7.1 API Mapping through 7.3 Security) appears duplicated verbatim (first occurrence shows “C Library API (C99/C11)” header and memory model; second occurrence is substantively the same earlier version). This creates confusion and inflates length. fileciteturn2file12L10-L18 and duplicated security + mitigation list fileciteturn2file12L46-L54.  \n\n**1.2 Complexity bullets inconsistent / line-break fragmented** – Big-O expressions are broken across lines in a way that obscures exponents; e.g. `O(mn d2` then `max)` rather than a single math token. fileciteturn2file12L2-L8 and also convolution complexity with split exponent lines in the later list. fileciteturn2file2L53-L56.  \n\n**1.3 Mixed / conflicting complexity formulas** – Two variants of Model A appear: one lists matrix-vector multiply cost (Theorem 6.12 style) without the `d1` (inner dimension) factor, another includes `d1` for matrix *matrix* multiply cost `O(m n d1 d_max log d_max)`. Ensure each formula is clearly scoped (matrix-vector vs matrix-matrix) and labeled; currently readers see both without context. Compare theorem bullet style (matrix-vector) fileciteturn2file12L2-L8 vs matrix-matrix complexity list (Algorithm section) fileciteturn2file2L53-L56.  \n\n**1.4 Memory complexity statement needs formal bound** – You improved wording to `Σ vdim(C_ij) ≤ O(m n d_max)` but this remains an *inequality assertion* without a lemma proving the sum’s upper bound; add a short lemma deriving the bound from per-entry `vdim ≤ d_max`. fileciteturn2file2L57-L59.  \n\n**1.5 Security / implementation status duplication & drift** – Security mitigations list is repeated; “Implementation Status” (single-threaded CPU only) now conflicts with claims elsewhere (older version said parallelism / OpenMP planned; here it omits concurrency specifics). fileciteturn2file2L19-L23 and duplicate mitigation list already cited. Ensure a single authoritative subsection.  \n\n**1.6 Algorithm 1 vs Complexity narrative** – FFT padding rule is correct in v0.47 (`L = next pow2(2 d_max − 1)`), but earlier duplication might still include the older variant (`2 d_max`) if remnants persist (check older copy to ensure removed—present in earlier version, not cited here). Confirm only one Algorithm 1 appears. Current algorithm lines fine. fileciteturn2file2L34-L42.  \n\n**1.7 Conservation Properties claim needs formal theorem** – Currently stated informally: invariance of additive sums “follows directly” from semiring homomorphism; add a numbered lemma referencing additive monoid structure and promotion/unpromotion as monoid endomorphisms. fileciteturn2file8L8-L13.  \n\n**1.8 Experimental section still purely theoretical** – Section 9 labeled “Experimental Results” yet provides only projections; clarify title to “Theoretical / Projected Performance” or add even minimal empirical CPU benchmark table. fileciteturn2file8L14-L22 and claims of expected advantages fileciteturn2file8L24-L29.  \n\n**1.9 Gradient / VJP section line-break artifacts & storage-independence proof** – The updated VJP correctness proof is present, but earlier part of the section is missing the addition VJP in the snippet (ensure terminology consistency: `unprom` vs `unpad`). “Stacking operator Sk” consistent now (good); still ensure `Sk` defined earlier (stacking operator symbol change from previous Σk notation). fileciteturn2file10L7-L14 and unpromotion justification lines fileciteturn2file10L23-L30.  \n\n**1.10 Notation consistency for stacking** – Earlier versions used Σk; current uses both `Sk` (proof) and possibly Σk elsewhere (verify no residual Σk). Present snippet uses `Sk` uniformly; ensure global search removed Σk to avoid dual notation. fileciteturn2file10L7-L13.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Medium-Priority Issues (Clarity, Rigor, Polish)\n\n**2.1 Promotion example fragmentation** – Shape promotion example appears truncated mid-sentence where earlier lines already give the 3×5 + 7×2 explanation (still fine, but check for repetition). fileciteturn2file2L1-L4 (tail end of zero-padding avoidance sentence).  \n\n**2.2 Adaptive sparsity & efficiency claims** – Statement of theoretical sparse efficiency is qualitative (“theoretical foundation for efficient sparse operations”) without asymptotic form (e.g. `O(nnz log d_max)` vs `O(nnz)`). fileciteturn2file8L12-L17. Provide a proposition quantifying cost in terms of total stored coefficients `N = Σ vdim(A_ij)` for addition and convolution.  \n\n**2.3 Figure 3 labeling acceptable but still internal** – Axis clarifications now in caption (good) but ensure font size legibility; lines show axis labels embedded as text. fileciteturn2file8L38-L46.  \n\n**2.4 Conservation wording** – “unpromption” typo (“unpromotion” intended). fileciteturn2file8L8-L13.  \n\n**2.5 Capitalization of GPUs** – Ensure consistent “ROCm” (in older versions sometimes “RoCM” / “CUDA/RoCM”; present snippet uses “CUDA/RoCM”—should be “CUDA/ROCm”). fileciteturn2file2L50-L53.  \n\n**2.6 API standard specification** – API header lists “C99/C11”; pick a minimum (C11 if atomics used) to avoid confusion. fileciteturn2file12L12-L18.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Lower-Priority / Stylistic\n\n**3.1 Redundant wording** – “Complexity Analysis: The FFT size L is chosen…” appears twice (once before bullet list and again near algorithm). Consolidate to a single introduction. fileciteturn2file2L46-L53 and earlier complexity preface lines.  \n\n**3.2 Minor typographic spacing** – Ensure consistent use of thin spaces in `d_{\\max}` and avoid `dmax` without subscript for final copy; multiple occurrences un-subscripted. fileciteturn2file2L53-L56.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Positive Improvements (Retain)\n\n* **Memory sum bound now explicitly written with Σ notation** – Clearer than earlier flat `O(m n d_max)` claim. fileciteturn2file2L57-L59.  \n* **FFT padding rule standardized** – All algorithm lines use `next pow2(2 d_max − 1)` (correct for linear convolution). fileciteturn2file2L34-L39.  \n* **VJP correctness proof extended with chain rule and block Jacobian articulation** – Strengthens AD rigor. fileciteturn2file10L32-L40 and final equality lines fileciteturn2file10L44-L47.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Recommended Concrete Fixes (Checklist)\n\n| Category | Action |\n|----------|--------|\n| Duplication | Remove second (or earlier) duplicate of 7.x (API, Memory, Security). fileciteturn2file12L10-L18 |\n| Complexity | Introduce a table distinguishing *matrix–vector* vs *matrix–matrix* costs; unify notation `(m×d1)(d1×n)` and `d_{\\max}`; keep expressions on one line. fileciteturn2file2L53-L56 |\n| Memory Lemma | Add Lemma: `Total stored coeffs = Σ vdim(C_ij) ≤ m n d_max` with proof by bounding each term. fileciteturn2file2L57-L59 |\n| Conservation | Add Lemma “Promotion and unpromotion are additive monoid homomorphisms ⇒ sum invariant” and correct typo “unpromption.” fileciteturn2file8L8-L13 |\n| Sparse Complexity | Provide formal cost in terms of `N = Σ vdim(A_ij)` for addition, convolution; remove vague “foundation” phrasing. fileciteturn2file8L12-L17 |\n| Experimental Section | Rename Section 9 or add minimal empirical table (CPU vs zero-padding baseline) to justify “Experimental Results.” fileciteturn2file8L14-L22 |\n| AD Section | Ensure `Sk` definition supplied earlier; remove any lingering Σk occurrences globally. fileciteturn2file10L7-L14 |\n| Terminology | Normalize to “ROCm” and define minimum C standard (C11). fileciteturn2file2L50-L53 and fileciteturn2file12L12-L18 |\n| Typos | Fix “unpromption” → “unpromotion.” fileciteturn2file8L8-L13 |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Questions for You (to guide next iteration)\n\n1. Will Section 9 gain empirical data in the next revision, or should the title be changed now? (Current wording may mislead reviewers). fileciteturn2file8L14-L22  \n2. Do you intend to keep both matrix-vector and matrix-matrix complexity theorems? If so, will you introduce a general parameterization to avoid duplication? fileciteturn2file12L2-L8 and fileciteturn2file2L53-L56  \n3. Where is `Sk` formally defined (what section/definition number) after switching from Σk? (Not in retrieved snippet; ensure cross-reference.) fileciteturn2file10L7-L14  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Suggested Short Additions (Ready-Made Text You Can Adapt)\n\n**Lemma (Additive Invariance under Promotion).** *For any tensor x with minimal representative (d,v) and any target shape n ≥ d, promotion prom_n is an injective monoid homomorphism; unpromotion is its left inverse on the image. Thus for any finite multiset {x_i}, Σ_i sum(x_i) = sum(unprom(prom(x_i))) (componentwise).*\n\n**Sparse Addition Cost Proposition.** *Let A,B ∈ R^{m×n} with minimal representative total size N = Σ_{i,j}(vdim(A_{ij}) + vdim(B_{ij})). Then C = A+B can be computed in O(N) time and O(1) extra space beyond output, since each pair of entries requires at most one linear merge / padding pass bounded by vdim(A_{ij}) + vdim(B_{ij}).*\n\n(Feel free to request more fully typeset LaTeX if helpful.)\n\n---\n\n### 8. Overall Assessment\n\nProgress: Minor refinement (added Σ-sum memory bound form, clarified FFT padding) and AD proof expansion. Remaining blockers: duplication cleanup, precise complexity scoping, formalization of conservation & sparse complexity, and truthful labeling of “Experimental” section.\n\nOnce these are addressed, the manuscript will read more cohesively and be ready for an external pre-submission review.\n\nLet me know when you have v0.48 (or if you want LaTeX patch suggestions); I can do a rapid delta review focusing only on the amended sections.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like specific LaTeX regex to remove duplicates or a template for the complexity table, just ask.",

Tie completion theorem to standard ℓ¹ completion references (functional analysis baseline; Rudin).\n3. **Complexity Section**: When asserting FFT complexity vs naive convolution, cite FFT and fast multiplication algorithms (Karatsuba, Cantor–Kaltofen) to substantiate “sub-quadratic potential”.\n4. **Stacking / Multi-resolution**: Add wavelet / pyramid (Mallat, Burt & Adelson) to justify analogy; multigrid if you claim coarse-to-fine solves.\n5. **Sparse / Memory Model**: Near claims of sparse advantages (e.g., where you state “sparse-by-design” or scaling advantages—see lines describing expected performance & scaling advantages. fileciteturn3file10L21-L30 plus performance projection earlier. fileciteturn3file17L6-L13), add GraphBLAS and CSR/COO canonical references (Saad *Iterative Methods*, Buluc & Gilbert).\n6. **Automatic Differentiation**: In the integration/future work paragraph about dynamic Jacobians (variable-shape AD challenges. fileciteturn3file6L2-L9), cite Griewank & Walther plus Pearlmutter, and a JAX design doc if available (or fallback to Bradbury et al.—already present. fileciteturn3file10L23-L24).\n7. **Invariants / Conservation**: Where conservation is claimed (currently in earlier versions; make sure it remains—scaling & invariants claims in introduction / methodology. fileciteturn3file17L6-L13), cite LeVeque or a finite volume / semiring modeling reference to legitimize the framing.\n8. **Applications**: In domain subsections (biology, climate, finance. fileciteturn3file10L2-L11) insert *one* domain reference each (e.g., genome variable-length alignment algorithms, adaptive mesh refinement for climate, order book modeling literature) to show awareness—keep to key exemplars to avoid bloating.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Target Reference Count & Balance\n\n| Category | Current | Target | Notes |\n|----------|---------|--------|-------|\n| ML Frameworks / Ragged | 3 | 5–6 | Add PyTorch NestedTensor paper/issue, TF Ragged whitepaper (if citable), dynamic conv |\n| Algebra (rings, semirings, Rees) | 1 narrative only | 5 | Eisenbud, von zur Gathen & Gerhard, Gondran & Minoux, Horn & Johnson (Kronecker), Bruns & Herzog |\n| Sparse / Graph / Formats | 1 (SuiteSparse) | 4–5 | GraphBLAS spec, Buluc & Gilbert survey, Saad, block-sparse (e.g., NVIDIA CUTLASS doc if allowed) |\n| Fast Algorithms (FFT etc.) | 0 explicit | 3 | Cooley–Tukey, Karatsuba, Cantor–Kaltofen (or Schönhage–Strassen if you mention asymptotics) |\n| AD Theory | 0 (beyond frameworks) | 2–3 | Griewank & Walther, Pearlmutter (reverse AD) |\n| Multiresolution / Pyramids | 0 | 2 | Mallat, Burt & Adelson |\n| Applications (optional) | 0 | 3 | One each for genomics, climate AMR, financial order books |\n| Quantum / Edge (optional) | 0 | 1–2 | Nielsen & Chuang; dynamic circuit compilation paper |\n\n**Total**: move from ~6 to ~25–30 well-chosen citations. That’s normal for a theory+systems hybrid paper.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Framing to Avoid Reviewer Pushback\n\n- **Phrase additions as lineage, not dependency**: “Our completion theorem specializes classical results on ℓ¹ completions of polynomial algebras [Eisenbud, Rudin] to the variable-shape context.”\n- **Differentiate from STP**: Emphasize *object model* (equivalence classes, dual semiring choice) versus STP’s *operation extension by Kronecker lifting* (you already contrast motivation. fileciteturn3file17L24-L30).\n- **Rees algebra analogy**: Add explicit caveat that VSLA is *not* introducing a new algebraic invariant, but choosing a computationally structured subcategory suited to variable-shape optimization (explicit narrative exists but strengthen with citations. fileciteturn3file14L1-L15).\n- **Conservation**: Replace “follows directly” with a lemma referencing semiring homomorphism preserves additive monoid; cite a standard conservation text rather than leaving unmoored.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Implementation of Additions (LaTeX Macro Tip)\n\nCreate a `\\relatedalg{}` macro to group algebraic citations so you can easily prune later:\n\n```tex\n\\newcommand{\\fastpoly}{\\cite{CooleyTukey1965,Karatsuba1962,VonZurGathenGerhard}}\n```\n\nThen drop `\\fastpoly` once in the complexity subsection instead of scattering individual cites.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Prioritize (If Time Is Limited)\n\n1. **Algebra & fast algorithms** (core theoretical grounding).  \n2. **Sparse / GraphBLAS** (validates memory & operator semantics claims).  \n3. **AD theory** (backs future work & gradient section).  \n4. **Multiresolution** (justifies stacking operator analogy).  \n5. **Domain exemplars** (only if space permits).  \n\n---\n\n### 8. Concrete Next Steps\n\n1. **Add a “Related Work” subsection** just before “Applications” or after “Foundations” consolidating new citations, with cross-references back into earlier sections.\n2. **Refactor in-text claims** to replace generic phrases (“sub-quadratic algorithms exist”) with *cited* statements.\n3. **Run a citation coverage audit**: every paragraph making a *nontrivial comparative or theoretical claim* should now contain ≥1 citation (except purely definitional paragraphs introducing your own notation).\n\n---\n\n### 9. Example Revision Snippets\n\n> *Current:* “Other sub-quadratic algorithms … could be adapted …”  \n> *Revised:* “Other sub-quadratic multiplication algorithms—Karatsuba for moderate degrees and algorithms based on FFT / divide-and-conquer strategies for higher degrees [Karatsuba 1962; Cooley & Tukey 1965; von zur Gathen & Gerhard]—map directly through the polynomial isomorphism, yielding potential \\(O(d^{\\log_2 3})\\) or \\(O(d \\log d)\\) VSLA convolution kernels.”\n\n> *Current:* “VSLA operations preserve additive invariants…”  \n> *Revised:* “Promotion/unpromotion are additive monoid homomorphisms; hence for any finite family the coefficient sum is invariant (Lemma X), mirroring discrete conservation principles in finite volume schemes [LeVeque].”\n\n---\n\n### 10. Answer to Your Core Question\n\n**Yes—add substantially more references.** Build deliberate bridges to algebraic foundations, sparse linear algebra standards, fast polynomial algorithms, AD theory, and multiresolution analysis. This will *both* legitimize the mathematical framing and pre-empt “insufficient related work” reviewer critiques.\n\n---\n\nIf you implement the above clusters your paper’s novelty will read as *positioned* rather than isolated, increasing acceptance odds.\n\nLet me know once you’ve inserted the new citations if you’d like a coverage pass (but you can follow the priority list independently).",

I focus only on items still improvable or potentially questioned by reviewers. All observations are grounded in the current v0.49 text.  \n\n---\n\n### 0. Overall Status\n\nThe paper has substantially matured: formal definitions, proofs (semiring, completion), stacking operator algebra, complexity table, AD/VJP section, security & implementation clarifications, and expanded related work are now present (e.g. Definitions & Propositions, semiring isomorphism, completion proof, stacking properties, complexity table, conservation lemma, AD VJPs). Citations have improved but a few clusters are still thin or partly uncited (see §5).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Mathematical Rigor & Proof Adjustments\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| MATH-01 | **Clarify notation for degree/dimension**: unify `vdim` vs “degree” wording early; currently both appear (isomorphism & graded ring discussion) without a single declarative equivalence statement. Cite where both used. | Avoid reviewer confusion about whether degree = vdim or distinct. | Add a sentence in §3 or start of §4 explicitly: “We use `vdim(x)` and ‘degree’ interchangeably (cf. Theorem 4.3 & graded ring discussion).” |\n| MATH-02 | **Add explicit statement of commutativity for Model A vs non-commutativity for Model B in one comparative lemma.** | Currently commutativity of convolution proved (lines for associativity/commutativity) and non-commutativity shown later for Kronecker product; a comparative lemma aids readers. | New Lemma summarizing: Model A commutative semiring; Model B non-commutative unless scalar operand (cite scalar commutation proposition). |\n| MATH-03 | **Tighten Completion Theorem wording**: clarify topology distinction (ℓ₁ vs formal power series topology) and remove “proper sub-ring” → “proper subalgebra” unless ring structure over R[[x]] is intended with same operations (check lines). | Precision: reviewers may nitpick topology phrasing. | Revised wording: “proper subalgebra of (R[[x]], +, ·) under coefficientwise convergence topology” & confirm no ambiguity. |\n| MATH-04 | **Explicitly state conditions of Lemma 8.1**: clarify coefficient sum operator symbol (currently sum indices formatting slightly broken). | Minor typesetting / readability; ensure no ambiguity in invariance lemma. | Lemma 8.1 displays clean summation indices (∑_{i=1}^{vdim(v)}). |\n\n**Supporting Citations:** degree ↔ polynomial isomorphism (semiring isomorphism) fileciteturn5file0L217-L224, graded ring text where “degree” used fileciteturn5file0L307-L315, convolution commutativity proof lines fileciteturn5file0L206-L211, Kronecker non-commutativity example & scalar commutation proposition fileciteturn5file0L450-L455 and fileciteturn5file0L463-L466, completion theorem & proof lines fileciteturn5file0L336-L344 and fileciteturn5file0L346-L354, conservation lemma lines fileciteturn5file0L1048-L1056.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consistency & Notation / Typographical Issues\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| CONS-01 | **Uniform symbol for stacking operator**: Abstract and earlier sections use `S` while examples/lemmas later use `Sk`; ensure consistent (some earlier versions had Σk). | Avoid residual confusion from older notation. | No lingering Σ / Sk inconsistency; abstract uses same form as formal Definition 6.1 (Sk). |\n| CONS-02 | **Fix minor wrap / hyphenation issues** (e.g., “ten\u0002sor”, “computational flex\u0002ibility”). | PDF line-breaking artifacts may annoy reviewers. | Recompile with `\\usepackage[hyphens]{url}` and perhaps `\\hypersetup{...}`; remove stray discretionary hyphen markers; no mid-word line breaks in final PDF. |\n| CONS-03 | **Check truncated citation line for Cantor–Kaltofen** (appears cut: “Cantor and Kaltofen, 199” missing year). | Incomplete citation weakens credibility. | Completed citation year (1991) or correct reference; bibliography entry present. |\n\n**Citations:** stacking definition lines fileciteturn5file0L466-L473, example lines where Sk used fileciteturn5file0L537-L543, convolution complexity claim uses dmax formatting; ensure consistent subscript (d\\_max) vs plain. Complexity table lines for operations memory row has truncation “Minimal representa” fileciteturn5file0L954-L960.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Complexity & Performance Presentation\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| COMP-01 | **Add reference or remark for FFT padding choice** describing L = next_pow2(2 d_max − 1) and discuss possible non-power-of-two FFT libraries (e.g., mixed radix) to preempt reviewer remark. | Shows awareness of advanced FFT implementations; avoids impression of unnecessary padding. | One sentence appended after Algorithm 1 complexity note acknowledging alternative radix & trade-offs. |\n| COMP-02 | **Clarify matrix-vector vs matrix-matrix complexity symbol usage**: Table 2 uses `d1` and `dmax`—add a pre-table line defining d1 (inner dimension) distinct from per-entry vdim maxima. | Avoid ambiguity between structural inner dimension and per-entry maximal degree. | Added preface: “Here d1 is the *structural* inner dimension (matrix shape), dmax := max_{i,j} vdim(T_{ij}).” |\n| COMP-03 | **Add lower-bound/optimality remark for Model B O(m n d_max^2)** indicating whether any sub-quadratic is possible under current representation (link to lexical ordering constraints). | Reviewers may ask if naive; defend or scope. | Short remark after complexity table referencing inherent Kronecker expansion size. |\n| COMP-04 | **Fix truncated 'Minimal representa'** in Table 2 last column. | Editorial precision. | Table text reads “…Minimal representative storage.” |\n\n**Citations:** Algorithm 1 complexity lines fileciteturn5file0L915-L923 and padding/FFT size choice lines fileciteturn5file0L929-L938; complexity table lines fileciteturn5file0L943-L951 and memory lemma lines fileciteturn5file0L961-L967; Model B complexity statement lines fileciteturn5file0L844-L851.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Implementation & Security Section Refinements\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| IMPL-01 | **Explicitly enumerate thread-safety guarantees** (currently only broad statement). | Preempts reviewer asking “What is safe now?” | Bullet list under Implementation Status: no global mutable state, deterministic single-threaded kernels, validated shape metadata pre-op. |\n| IMPL-02 | **Clarify C standard**: API mapping snippet tags “C99/C11” but aligned_alloc branch uses C11 detection; unify claim as “Requires C11” or specify fallback strategy precisely. | Consistency; currently ambiguous. | Replace header “C Library API (C11)” and add note about POSIX `posix_memalign` fallback for pre-C11 compilers. |\n| IMPL-03 | **Add explicit failure behavior for allocation/resource limit triggers**. | Security reviewers may ask: does function return error code vs abort? | Additional bullet: “All allocation failures & resource limit violations return a distinct vsla_error_t code; library never aborts.” |\n\n**Citations:** API mapping snippet lines fileciteturn5file0L857-L866; memory alignment lines fileciteturn5file0L882-L889; security safeguards lines fileciteturn5file0L897-L905; implementation status lines fileciteturn5file0L909-L914; implementation correction lines fileciteturn5file0L1115-L1120.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Citations & Related Work Coverage Gaps\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| REF-01 | **Complete missing fast multiplication citations** (Karatsuba present; Cantor–Kaltofen truncated; add Schönhage–Strassen or Fürer only if you mention asymptotic improvements explicitly). | Avoid incomplete bibliographic entry. | Full citation line appears; remove trailing truncation. |\n| REF-02 | **Add specific sparse format citations earlier** when contrasting with CSR/COO (currently referenced later; see lines referencing CSR, COO, GraphBLAS). | Strengthens early motivation vs existing sparse standards. | Insert parenthetical citation in Limitations or VSLA Solution section referencing [Mattson et al., 2021] & [Buluç and Gilbert, 2011]. |\n| REF-03 | **Quantum / tensor network claims** (Kronecker non-commutativity practical implications) currently un-cited. | Reviewers may request references for MPS / PEPS statement. | Add citations to standard tensor network review(s) next to MPS/PEPS mention. |\n| REF-04 | **AD theory references properly placed** but ensure both Griewank & Walther (2008) and Pearlmutter (1994) appear in bibliography (they are cited in VJP section lines). | Prevent missing bib entries. | Bib contains those entries, builds without “?.” |\n| REF-05 | **Add multiresolution pyramid references into Section 6.2** (you cite Burt & Adelson, Mallat lines exist). Ensure both appear in bibliography. | Completeness of claims. | Bibliography entries for Burt & Adelson (1983) and Mallat (1999) present. |\n\n**Citations:** truncated Cantor–Kaltofen line fileciteturn5file0L973-L978; CSR/COO & GraphBLAS contrast lines fileciteturn5file0L1068-L1072; tensor pyramid references lines (Burt & Adelson, Mallat) fileciteturn5file0L660-L663; AD theory citation lines fileciteturn5file0L1170-L1173; Kronecker practical implications lines needing tensor network refs fileciteturn5file0L454-L462.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Algebra–Implementation Bridge\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| BRIDGE-01 | **Add a short subsection “Abstraction Overhead & When VSLA Helps”** enumerating regimes (sparsity ratio, heterogeneity of vdim) where overhead of shape metadata < gains. | Reviewers often ask for boundaries of applicability; currently only positive framing. | New subsection after Table 2 giving simple inequality / heuristic (e.g., overhead O(k) vs saved zero ops). |\n| BRIDGE-02 | **Quantify memory alignment benefit** (state alignment assumption enables vectorized loads of length 64 / fits AVX-512 lanes). | Strengthens performance rationale; currently only states alignment fact. | One sentence after alignment code estimating worst-case padding waste vs improved throughput. |\n\n**Citations:** alignment lines fileciteturn5file0L882-L889; sparsity/storage rationale lines fileciteturn5file0L954-L960 and sparse efficiency claims in projection lines fileciteturn5file0L1088-L1093.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Automatic Differentiation Enhancements\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| AD-01 | **Add explicit VJP formula for Kronecker product** (present for convolution, addition, stacking; missing for Model B). | Completeness; reviewers will expect parallel treatment. | New paragraph: gradients via partial Kronecker expansions & reshape (or note deferred). |\n| AD-02 | **Clarify gradient shape coercion** for convolution reversal (explicitly state how trimming/padding occurs to match original vdim). | Avoid ambiguity about gradient dimension handling. | Added sentence within convolution VJP paragraph. |\n| AD-03 | **State limitations**: no gradient across operations that *create* new axes except via defined stacking VJP; mention future generalization. | Sets correct expectation. | One-sentence limitation statement. |\n\n**Citations:** Addition VJP lines fileciteturn5file0L1181-L1188; convolution VJP lines fileciteturn5file0L1189-L1193; stacking VJP lines fileciteturn5file0L1195-L1199; overall AD theory cite lines fileciteturn5file0L1170-L1173.  \n\n---\n\n### 8. Applications & Claims Tightening\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| APP-01 | **Add quantitative example** in sensor fusion (currently gives shapes & 85% waste claim—supply the calculation). | Makes efficiency claim verifiable. | Insert computation: “(7·3·64 − (3·3·64 + 7·1·32 + 5·2·16)) / (7·3·64) ≈ 0.85 wasted.” |\n| APP-02 | **Check symbol mismatch in example**: Stacking operator in applications section uses S3 but earlier line uses Σk somewhere historically; ensure uniform. | Consistency. | No Σk remains; only Sk. |\n| APP-03 | **Ensure dynamic convo / adaptive computation references** appear in bibliography (dynamic convolution & Graves). | Completeness of claims in adaptive AI section. | Bibliography entries present; no “??”. |\n\n**Citations:** Sensor fusion example lines fileciteturn5file0L1269-L1276; adaptive architectures referencing dynamic convolution/adaptive computation lines fileciteturn5file0L1298-L1302.  \n\n---\n\n### 9. Minor Editorial & Formatting\n\n| ID | Action | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| EDIT-01 | **Normalize capitalization**: “CUDA/ROCm” vs code comment currently “CUDA/ROCm” (good) — ensure no “CUDA/RoCM” variants elsewhere. | Professional polish. | Global search: only “CUDA/ROCm”. |\n| EDIT-02 | **Check for stray TeX artifacts in figure captions** (e.g., Figure 1 & 2 multi-line splitting). | Readability. | Captions read without mid-word breaks. |\n| EDIT-03 | **Add label & reference for each theorem/lemma actually cited** (e.g., Theorem 6.12 cited in advantages lines). | Cross-reference integrity. | Every textual “Theorem X.Y” reference resolves; no “??”. |\n\n**Citations:** Implementation performance / parallelization lines referencing CUDA/ROCm fileciteturn5file0L985-L987; advantages citing Theorem 6.12 lines fileciteturn5file0L1003-L1007 and scaling figure discussion lines fileciteturn5file0L1095-L1098.  \n\n---\n\n### 10. Suggested Order of Fixes\n\n1. CONS / REF quick fixes (truncate citation, table text, symbol unification).  \n2. Complexity & AD additions (Model B VJP, Kronecker optimality remark).  \n3. Proof clarifications (degree notation, completion wording).  \n4. Implementation consistency (C standard, thread-safety bullets).  \n5. Bridge subsection & quantitative sensor fusion example.  \n6. Final pass: hyphenation / broken words / figure captions / labels.\n\n---\n\n### 11. Ready-for-Submission Criteria\n\nAll entries in this list marked complete; no truncated words; bibliography expanded & complete; consistent notation; explicit handling of all primitive VJPs; Model B cost contextualized; implementation claims conservative & accurate.\n\n---\n\nIf you execute the above list, you will eliminate the remaining reviewer friction points. Let me know after you implement if you want a *final* pre-submission sanity check (not offering further work now per your instruction).",

What remains are **presentation polish** and a **slightly thin bibliography** for a venue that values prior-art positioning.*\n\nBelow is a punch-list you (or a delegated co-author) can run through; each item is genuinely actionable and does **not** presume further labour from me.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Typesetting / polish (fast wins)\n\n| Location | Issue | Fix tip |\n|---|---|---|\n| Table 2 “Operation Complexity Summary”, last row | Heading line breaks as “Minimal representative stor-\\*age” due to automatic hyphenation fileciteturn10file8L958-L975 | Either shorten to **“Minimal rep. storage”** or force a no-hyphen break with `\\mbox{}` / `\\raggedright` inside the tabular cell. |\n| Algorithm 1 caption | “FFT-Accelerated Convolution (Model A)” is rendered, but the algorithm body overflows the column at 80 mm width fileciteturn10file8L931-L948 | Wrap the pseudo-code in `\\footnotesize` and add `\\SetAlgoVlined` (algorithm2e) or `\\scriptsize` for listings to avoid spillover. |\n| References: Spanish acute appears as “Or´us” | Use proper LaTeX accents: `Or\\'us` in `.bib`. |\n| Ai-tools disclosure §14 | Many double-blind conferences ban author-identifying acknowledgements. Put disclosure in an anonymous appendix or remove until camera-ready. |\n\n---\n\n## 2  Mathematical clarity\n\n| Topic | Observation | Action |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Promotion/Unpromotion invariance** | Lemma 8.1 gives coefficient-sum preservation but only for **additive** invariants fileciteturn10file8L1066-L1081. Readers may ask about *multiplicative* invariants (e.g., L¹-norm after convolution). | Add one-sentence remark that multiplicative invariance does *not* hold in general and is not required for the semiring proofs. |\n| **Stacking complexity** | Proposition 6.8 states Θ(N + k·Δ) but Δ is defined informally fileciteturn10file8L755-L760. | Give Δ an explicit bound, e.g. “Δ ≤ dₘₐₓ − minᵢ vdim Aᵢ”. |\n| **Lemma numbering drift** | Lemma 4.5 (“Commutativity Comparison”) fileciteturn10file8L405-L407 and Lemma 5.5 have near-identical names. Consider renaming 5.5 to **“Scalar-commutation lemma for Model B”** to avoid cross-references confusion. |\n\n---\n\n## 3  Implementation section\n\n| Line(s) | Issue | Action |\n|---|---|---|\n| API bullets lines 884-887 fileciteturn10file8L35-L38 | “Immutable tensors” + “per-tensor ref-count” is excellent, but the phrase **“No global mutable state”** could be read as ruling out internal allocators. | Clarify: “No global mutable state *visible* to the user; internal memory pools are thread-safe and hidden.” |\n| Memory‐model paragraph lines 893-906 fileciteturn10file8L891-L906 | Phrase “capacity[i] = next_pow2(shape[i])” is C-style; in prose, use `next_pow2` or “power-of-two rounding” consistently. | Minor wording tweak. |\n\n---\n\n## 4  Bibliography depth\n\nThe reference list is ~30 entries, but two key angles are lightly cited:\n\n1. **Semiring & dioid computation** – add at least one of:\n   * Gondran & Minoux (already cited) is good; consider also Backhouse et al. *“Generic Programming of Algebraic Structures in Programming Languages”* if space permits.\n\n2. **Monoidal-category approaches to tensor programming** – a short pointer to Selinger’s *“A survey of graphical languages for monoidal categories”* or Fong & Spivak’s *“Seven Sketches in Compositionality”* will satisfy theoretical readers.\n\n3. **Variable-shape tensor libraries** – you cite TF Ragged Tensors and PyTorch NestedTensor; include at least one peer-reviewed systems paper (e.g., *Varuna*, *Megablocks*) to pre-empt reviewers’ “related work” flags.\n\nNo need to grow to 50+ references—4-5 strategic additions will look deliberate rather than padded.\n\n---\n\n## 5  Final sanity checks (pre-submission)\n\n* **PDF/A compliance** – run `verapdf` to avoid archive rejections.\n* **Compile warnings** – `latexmk -pdf -file-line-error -halt-on-error` should exit cleanly.\n* **Blind-review sweep** – ensure Git commit hashes, institution names, or emails are stripped from metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAddressing the table hyphenation, clarifying Δ, renaming Lemma 5.5, and adding 3–4 strategic references will leave reviewers with little to contest. The core mathematics, complexity claims, and implementation exposition already read as publication-ready.",
