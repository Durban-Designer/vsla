**Peer‑Review Report – round 3 (focus on the forthcoming “universal‑interface” rewrite)**
*Reviewer profile unchanged (Ph.D. computational mathematician, C‑library author).*

---

### 0  Scope of this addendum

The authors have indicated that the C99 reference implementation is being **re‑architected to expose a single public header and multiple pluggable back‑ends** (CPU, CUDA, Apple/Metal, AMD/ROCm, oneAPI/Intel, etc.). My remarks therefore concentrate on:

* API/ABI considerations for a *universal façade*
* modular back‑end selection and build tooling
* implications for the manuscript (v0.3) sections 8–10
* interaction with previously‑raised issues (GPU benchmarking, thread‑safety, artefact DOI, …)

Citations refer to the latest draft *vsla\_paper\_v0.3.pdf* unless stated otherwise.&#x20;

### 1  High‑level appraisal of the proposed rewrite

| Positives                                                                                                                                                                 | Concerns / open questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cleaner public surface** – a single header (`vsla.h`) will simplify adoption and versioning, aligning with mature projects such as *stb*, *cimg*, *GraphBLAS*’ `GrB.h`. | **Back‑end discovery**. Will selection occur at **compile‑time** (pre‑processor / CMake option), **link‑time** (static plugins), or **run‑time** (dlopen)? Clarify guarantees so that package maintainers (e.g., conda, vcpkg) can ship mutually compatible binaries. |
| **Back‑end symmetry** – the semiring core is agnostic to instruction set; an interface/impl split is natural.                                                             | **ABI stability** across GPU driver versions: for example, CUDA 12 vs 13 may change ELF symbols. Shield users via opaque handles and stable entry points.                                                                                                             |
| **Potential to close M2/M3** – a modular CUDA/ROCm back‑end can finally provide the required GPU benchmarks.                                                              | **Thread‑safety**: a single header often invites header‑only inline functions. Ensure that global state (allocator arenas, FFT plan caches, GPU context pools) remains race‑free.                                                                                     |

---

### 2  Specific technical recommendations

1. **Opaque handle design**
   *Expose* only an opaque `vsla_tensor` pointer in the public header. Keep `struct vsla_tensor_impl` in back‑end code. This prevents user code from hard‑coding internal layout and permits ABI‑safe upgrades.

2. **Feature negotiation API**
   Provide a *descriptor query* similar to `vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties` (Vulkan) or `cudaGetDeviceProperties`. For example:

   ```c
   typedef struct {
       uint32_t    api_version;    // encoded major.minor.patch
       uint32_t    backend;        // VSLA_BACKEND_CPU, _CUDA, ...
       uint64_t    vram_bytes;
       uint32_t    max_deg_supported;   // hardware limits
       char        name[64];
   } vsla_device_info_t;

   size_t vslaEnumerateDevices(vsla_device_info_t *out, size_t capacity);
   ```

   This will let high‑level frameworks pick the best device at run‑time.

3. **Back‑end dispatch pattern**

   | Option                                        | Pros                                                                                          | Cons                                                             |
   | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | *Compile‑time macros* (`-DVSLA_BACKEND=CUDA`) | zero indirection, full inlining                                                               | N builds for N back‑ends, awkward for Python wheels              |
   | *Link‑time weak‑symbol override*              | simple CMake; user links `libvsla_cuda.so` to get GPU kernels                                 | symbol resolution errors when a requested GPU library is missing |
   | *Run‑time plug‑in (dlopen)* **recommended**   | single host library + optional `vsla_backend_cuda.so`, ¬ crash when absent; mirrors cuBLAS LT | slight overhead in first call, more code                         |

   Whichever path you choose, document it in §8 (“Implementation Design”).&#x20;

4. **Memory‑alignment contract**
   The draft (p. 13) locks in *64‑byte* alignment. GPU buffers may require 256‑byte boundaries or *pitch*. Add a capability bit:

   ```c
   uint32_t alignment_bytes; // min required by this backend
   ```

5. **FFT and GEMM back‑ends**
   *CPU*: FFTW + OpenBLAS (GPL concerns?) or pocketfft + BLIS.
   *CUDA*: cuFFT, cuBLAS; *AMD*: rocFFT, rocBLAS; *oneAPI*: MKL‑DNN. Provide a small wrapper so that academic users without proprietary toolchains can fall back to pocketfft.

6. **Header‑only vs. inline vs. DLL**
   Embedding large static‑inline kernels in the public header bloats translation units and couples users to your build flags. Only trivial helpers (`vsla_degree`, `vsla_shape_rank`) should be `static inline`; heavy kernels belong in the back‑end libs.

7. **Error model**
   Convert `vsla_error_t` into a **non‑saturating enum** with distinct domains:
   *allocation*, *shape*, *backend\_unavailable*, *internal*. Return them uniformly across back‑ends.

8. **CMake “super‑build”**
   A top‑level `cmake/` script that detects GPUs, sets `VSLA_ENABLE_CUDA`, etc., and builds optional shared libraries is essential. This also solves artefact reproducibility (M7).

9. **Language bindings**
   Re‑verify the Python CFFI/Cython layer can load whichever plug‑in is present (`import vsla; vsla.load_backend("cuda")`). This avoids wheels that hard‑depend on CUDA‐enabled machines.

### 5  Questions / information requested for the next revision

1. **Back‑end discovery mechanism** (compile‑time vs link‑time vs run‑time).
2. **Planned list of mandatory vs optional back‑ends** (e.g., will Metal be “best‑effort”?).
3. **How will you test cross‑backend numerical equivalence** (unit tolerances, seed control)?
4. **Will the public header stay strictly C99**, or will you expose C11 threads/atomics?
5. **Benchmark plan**: hardware, datasets, and metric definitions.
6. **Licensing of third‑party dependencies** for each back‑end (FFTW GPL vs MIT pocketfft, etc.).

---

### 6  Verdict

**Major revision remains appropriate**. The universal‑interface rewrite is promising and, if executed well, will greatly strengthen the library’s practical appeal. The manuscript should be updated to describe the new architecture, and the implementation artefact must demonstrate at least one GPU back‑end with reproducible benchmarks.

I look forward to evaluating the next draft and the first alpha of the re‑architected codebase.
 lets talk through these points please and also I think we need to move to c11 or whatever the latest c is so we are modern and performative.

## 🤖 Assistant Message (00:28:22)

This is a thorough and well-structured review! The reviewer clearly understands the architectural challenges of creating a universal interface for heterogeneous compute backends. Let me break down the key decisions and my thoughts on each area:

## Backend Discovery Mechanism

The reviewer recommends **run-time plugin (dlopen)** approach, and I agree this is the strongest choice:

- **Pros**: Single library binary, graceful degradation when GPU libs missing, mirrors mature libraries like cuBLAS
- **Implementation**: `vsla.h` + `libvsla_core.so` + optional `libvsla_cuda.so`, `libvsla_rocm.so` etc.

## Modern C Standard

Absolutely agree on moving to **C11 or C17**:
- **C11 benefits**: `_Alignas`, atomics (`stdatomic.h`), thread-local storage, better inline semantics
- **C17**: Minor clarifications over C11, widely supported
- **Performance**: Better optimization hints, cleaner memory model

## Critical Design Decisions

**1. Opaque Handles** - Essential for ABI stability:
```c
typedef struct vsla_tensor_impl* vsla_tensor_t;  // opaque pointer
```

**2. Feature Negotiation** - The reviewer's API suggestion is excellent:
```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t api_version;
    uint32_t backend_type;
    uint64_t memory_bytes;
    uint32_t max_degree;
    uint32_t alignment_bytes;  // crucial for GPU pitch requirements
    char name[64];
} vsla_device_info_t;
```

**3. Thread Safety** - With C11 atomics, you can handle the global plugin registry safely:
```c
#include <stdatomic.h>
static _Atomic(vsla_backend_t*) active_backend = NULL;
```

## Questions for You

1. **Backend Priority**: Which backends are you planning as mandatory vs optional? (CPU definitely mandatory, CUDA high priority?)

2. **Dependency Strategy**: How do you feel about GPL dependencies like FFTW? The reviewer suggests pocketfft as MIT alternative.

3. **Testing Strategy**: How will you ensure numerical equivalence across backends? (critical for autodiff correctness)

4. **Build Complexity**: Are you comfortable with the CMake "super-build" approach to detect and conditionally build backends?

The reviewer's technical recommendations are solid. The universal interface pattern will definitely strengthen adoption and resolve the GPU benchmarking issues (M2/M3). 

What's your current thinking on the backend selection mechanism and C standard migration?

## 👤 User Message (00:32:44)

1. CPU and CUDA are mandatory, AMD is high priority, Intel and Apple are lower on the list but will eventually get done. We can do ARM when we do the apple too in case someone wants to use it embedded. 2. I would much prefer MIT license alternatives where possible but only if it wont hurt performance. We can roll multiple backends too as needed to support user needs as they arise. 3. Because the interface is identical we can run the same tests across all of the various hardware for each new version. This will require a multi step testing approach where each machine does its test and checks in its partial results, then the last machine stitches them together. Perhaps we can automate this across my various machines. 4. Cmake is already how it works so thats perfect

## Implementation Strategy

Based on your priorities, here's how I'd structure the approach:

**Backend Priority Implementation:**
1. **CPU** (mandatory) - OpenBLAS/BLIS + pocketfft for MIT compliance
2. **CUDA** (mandatory) - cuBLAS + cuFFT 
3. **AMD/ROCm** (high priority) - rocBLAS + rocFFT
4. **Intel/oneAPI** + **Apple/Metal** (future) - Can leverage same ARM work
5. **ARM** (with Apple implementation)

**Multi-Machine Testing Approach:**
Your idea of partial results + stitching is excellent. You could structure it as:
```
tests/
├── numerical_validation/
│   ├── generate_test_cases.py    # creates reference data
│   ├── run_backend_tests.py      # runs on each machine
│   ├── collect_results.py        # stitches partial results
│   └── validate_equivalence.py   # checks tolerances across backends
```

Each machine runs identical workloads, outputs JSON results, then a final validation step ensures numerical equivalence within reasonable tolerances.

**C Standard Migration Benefits:**
- **C11 atomics** for thread-safe backend registry
- **_Alignas** for proper GPU memory alignment
- **Thread-local storage** for per-thread contexts
- Better optimization potential

Should I start by examining your current codebase structure to understand the migration path from your current architecture to the universal interface design?

Web search results for query: "C23 C17 compiler support GCC Clang MSVC adoption 2025"

I'll search for information about C23 and C17 compiler support across GCC, Clang, and MSVC, including adoption status in 2025.

Links: [{"title":"C23 (C standard revision) - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C23_(C_standard_revision)"},{"title":"Compiler support for C23 - cppreference.com","url":"https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/compiler_support/23"},{"title":"C23 by Microsoft C compiler support: bugs or unimplemented features? - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79252411/c23-by-microsoft-c-compiler-support-bugs-or-unimplemented-features"},{"title":"Compiler support for C++23 - cppreference.com","url":"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/23"},{"title":"C23 Implications for C Libraries | Hacker News","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33691048"},{"title":"Clang - C Programming Language Status","url":"https://clang.llvm.org/c_status.html"},{"title":"C23: a slightly better C – Daniel Lemire's blog","url":"https://lemire.me/blog/2024/01/21/c23-a-slightly-better-c/"},{"title":"C23 is Finished: Here is What is on the Menu | The Pasture","url":"https://thephd.dev/c23-is-coming-here-is-what-is-on-the-menu"},{"title":"Microsoft C/C++ language conformance | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/overview/visual-cpp-language-conformance?view=msvc-170"},{"title":"C++17 - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++17"}]

Based on the search results, here's what I found about C23 and C17 compiler support across GCC, Clang, and MSVC:

## C23 Compiler Support (2025 Status)

### GCC
- GCC 15 and later now use C23 by default
- GCC 13 already has a compiler with some of the features from the latest standard (C23)

### Clang
- You can use Clang in C23 mode with the -std=c23 option (available in Clang 18 and later) or with the -std=c2x option (available in Clang 9 and later)
- LLVM (Clang) 16, you already have a compiler with some of the features from the latest standard (C23)

### MSVC
- MSVC has very limited C23 support as of 2025
- The latest and greatest MSVC last got updated in year 2022 to finally support ISO 9899:1989/Amd1:1995
- You can also get it to compile according to potentially non-conforming subsets of other withdrawn ISO standards such as C11 or C17 by adding /std:c11 or /std:c17. /std:clatest and /std:c17 is as of today's date the same thing

## C17 Compiler Support

### GCC, Clang
- Both GCC and Clang have had full C17 support for several years

### MSVC
- C11 Compiler support for C11 and C17 requires Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 or higher. Except as noted, C11 and C17 library support requires Windows SDK build 10.0.20211.0 or higher
- Visual Studio 2017 15.8 (MSVC 19.15) and later supports all C++17 language features (Note: This refers to C++17, not C17)

## Key C23 Timeline
- It was started in 2016 informally as C2x, and was published on October 31, 2024
- C23 was finished as far as voting on technical stuff in summer 2022, meaning that non-profit compilers like gcc and clang had almost 2 and a half year until the formal ISO release in October 2024 to fix support for the most important features

## Adoption Status in 2025
- GCC and Clang have made significant progress with C23 support, with GCC 15 even making it the default standard
- MSVC significantly lags behind in C standard support, still catching up with C11/C17 features
- They mostly managed, some features are still not supported (referring to GCC and Clang's C23 implementation)

The search results indicate that as of 2025, GCC and Clang have substantial C23 support with GCC 15 even defaulting to C23, while MSVC remains far behind in C language standard adoption, still working on proper C11/C17 conformance.

Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about CUDA NVCC compiler support for C17 and C23 standards as of 2025:

## CUDA NVCC C++ Standard Support

NVCC and NVRTC (CUDA Runtime Compiler) support the following C++ dialect: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20 on supported host compilers.(no content)The default C++ dialect of NVCC is determined by the default dialect of the host compiler used for compilation.

### Current Support Status (2025):

1. **C++17**: NVCC 11.0 supports device-side C++17 now, and this support has continued in newer versions of CUDA.

2. **C++20**: C++20 is supported with the following flavors of host compiler in both host and device code.

3. **C++23**: Based on the search results, there is no explicit mention of C++23 support in NVCC as of the latest documentation available. The highest standard mentioned is C++20.

### Key Points:

- The CUDA clang frontend is indeed ahead in C++ feature support, even in device code. It was already in the past, introducing C++14 features before NVCC

- The C++ dialect used for host and device code can be controlled using the --std or -std option. The default C++ dialect depends on the host compiler, with nvcc matching the default dialect by the host c++ compiler.

- In order to compile the CPU "Host" code in the CUDA source, the CUDA compiler NVCC requires a compatible host compiler to be installed on the system. NVCC performs a version check on the host compiler's major version

### Compatibility Notes:

- Still C++17 is not supported with Visual Studio (msvc). 2020-04-15 with even the latest releases of cuda 10.2 and Visual Studio 2019 msvc. However, this information appears to be outdated as newer CUDA versions have improved MSVC support.

- For the latest compatibility, MSVC 19.40 requires CUDA 12.4 or newer.

### Summary:

As of 2025, NVCC supports C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20. There is no current documentation indicating C++23 support in NVCC. If you need C++23 features, you may need to wait for future CUDA releases or consider using the Clang CUDA frontend, which historically has been ahead in C++ feature support.

## 🤖 Assistant Message (00:34:30)

Based on my research, here's the practical recommendation for your C standard choice:

## **Recommendation: C17**

**Why C17 over C23:**
- **CUDA Compatibility**: NVCC (crucial for your mandatory CUDA backend) supports up to C++20, but C language features lag behind. C17 is well-established in CUDA toolchains
- **Universal Support**: C17 has mature, stable support across GCC, Clang, and even MSVC
- **ROCm/HIP Compatibility**: AMD's ROCm tools are also more tested with C17

**Why C17 over C11:**
- Better optimization
- Cleaner threading model
- More modern alignment features
- Defect fixes from C11

**C23 Reality Check:**
- GCC/Clang: Good support but still incomplete
- MSVC: Still catching up to C11/C17 
- NVCC: No clear C23 timeline
- ROCm/oneAPI: Unverified compatibility
