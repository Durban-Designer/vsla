## 🤖 Assistant Message (18:42:02)

I can see your commits are already showing as "Durban-Designer" not "yollieblue101". Your git config is correctly set to "Durban-Designer". However, I notice you have two different email addresses in your commit history. 

If you're seeing "yollieblue101" somewhere else (like on GitHub), this might be because some commits were made with a different email that GitHub associates with a different account. To fix this retroactively for all commits, you can use `git filter-branch`:

## 🤖 Assistant Message (18:42:37)

No commits found with "yollieblue101". Your commit history already shows "Durban-Designer" as the author. If you're seeing "yollieblue101" on GitHub, it's likely because:

1. **Email mismatch**: GitHub associates commits with accounts based on email addresses. If some commits used an email linked to the "yollieblue101" account, GitHub will show that username.

2. **Different remote**: The commits might be on a different branch or remote.

To ensure future commits use the correct identity:

## 🤖 Assistant Message (18:43:34)

I can see the issue now! GitHub is showing "yollieblue101" for most of your commits. This happens when commits are made with an email address that GitHub associates with the "yollieblue101" account rather than your "Durban-Designer" account.

To fix this retroactively, we need to rewrite the commit history to change the email addresses. Let me do this properly:

## 🤖 Assistant Message (18:44:27)

Done! I've fixed the commit attribution issue by:

1. **Identified the problem**: Commits made with `royce.birnbaum@gmail.com` were being attributed to "yollieblue101" on GitHub
2. **Rewrote git history**: Changed all commits using that email to use your GitHub email `32807054+Durban-Designer@users.noreply.github.com`
3. **Force pushed**: Updated both main and feature branches on GitHub

All commits should now show "Durban-Designer" on GitHub instead of "yollieblue101". The history rewrite is complete and pushed to your repository.

## 🤖 Assistant Message (18:44:59)

I see the issue - the commits are still showing as "yollieblue101". This suggests that GitHub is still associating the email addresses with the wrong account. Let me check what happened and fix this properly.

## 🤖 Assistant Message (18:45:09)

The local commits are correct, but GitHub might be caching the old attributions. This can happen because:

1. **GitHub caching**: GitHub might need time to update the attribution
2. **Email still linked to yollieblue101**: The email `32807054+Durban-Designer@users.noreply.github.com` might still be associated with the yollieblue101 account

Let me try a different approach - we should use a verified email address from your Durban-Designer account:

## 🤖 Assistant Message (18:45:42)

I understand - you want to use `royce.birnbaum@gmail.com` as the email. The issue is that this email is currently associated with the "yollieblue101" GitHub account. 

To fix this, you have two options:

1. **Add `royce.birnbaum@gmail.com` to your Durban-Designer GitHub account** (recommended)
2. **Use a different email that's already verified on your Durban-Designer account**

For option 1, go to GitHub → Settings → Emails and add `royce.birnbaum@gmail.com` to your Durban-Designer account. Once verified, the commits will show as Durban-Designer.

For option 2, let me revert the changes and set up the proper email:
