# Research Proposal

**Title:** VSLA‑Pyramid Multi‑Encoder Networks for Hierarchical Time‑Series Reasoning

---

## Abstract
We propose to operationalize Variable‑Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA) window‑stacking and tensor‑pyramids as the foundation of a *multi‑encoder neural architecture* that simultaneously processes fine‑, mid‑, and long‑range temporal resolutions. Three lightweight encoders handle 1‑step ("reflex"), 10‑step ("burst"), and 50‑step ("context") views of streaming data; their representations are fused by an aggregator module trained end‑to‑end. We hypothesize that this design outperforms monolithic long‑window models on accuracy‑latency trade‑offs while enabling asynchronous clocks that mimic biological fast–slow cognition.

---

## Executive Summary
* **Gap:** VSLA theory introduces multiresolution tensor pyramids but no empirical demonstration within neural learning.
* **Innovation:** A tri‑branch, shape‑aware neural network leveraging VSLA promotion for zero‑copy multiscale batching; asynchronous encoder clocks for computational parsimony.
* **Outcome:** Benchmarks on physiological, financial, and industrial streams showing superior accuracy–latency Pareto fronts and open‑source PyTorch‑VSLA bridge.

## 1  Introduction & Context
VSLA guarantees algebraic closure under automatic shape promotion, removing the padding overhead that plagues ragged or dense time‑series tensors. This opens a path to real‑time multiscale inference where each additional temporal resolution costs Θ(N) copy only once at ingest.

---

## 2  Problem Statement
Single‑window models must rediscover short‑lived events buried inside long sequences, demanding deeper kernels or attention spreads. We seek a principled architecture that:
1. **Captures events across multiple horizons simultaneously.**
2. **Controls inference latency by clocking branches at different rates.**
3. **Stays memory‑efficient on sparse or bursty streams using VSLA.**

## 3  Core Innovation
| Layer | Contribution | VSLA Leverage |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Window Pyramid** | Build \{1,10,50\}‑step tensors every tick. | `Ω_w` & `S_k` stack without padding. |
| **Branch Encoders** | Causal 1‑D CNN / TCN tailored per resolution. | Shapes preserved; no manual masking. |
| **Aggregator** | Concatenation + MLP or cross‑scale attention. | Shared leading‑axis semantics guaranteed. |
| **Asynchronous Clocks** | Run 1‑step every tick, 10‑step every 5 ticks, 50‑step every 25. | VSLA promotion amortises update cost. |
| **Zero‑Copy Gradients** | Custom VJPs unstack during back‑prop. | Provided by VSLA library. |

* **Implementation:** PyTorch + VSLA C/CUDA kernels; mixed precision; single RTX 5090 (32 GB) for research scale.
* **Pipeline:** VSLA pyramid on CPU → pinned memory → GPU encoders → aggregator → task‑specific heads.

## 5  Research Questions & Hypotheses
1. **H1:** Tri‑branch VSLA‑pyramid models achieve lower validation loss than single 50‑step models at equal FLOPs.
2. **H2:** Asynchronous clocks reduce average latency ≥40 % with <2 % degradation in accuracy.
3. **H3:** VSLA promotion overhead is <5 % of total training time on RTX 5090.
