# Research Proposal

**Title:** Variable-Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA)–Driven Autonomous Physics Discovery Engine for Multi‑Scale (Sub‑Nuclear → Emergent) Universe Simulation

**Abstract:** We propose a *self‑contained* next‑phase research program that operationalizes the already proven Variable‑Shape Linear Algebra (VSLA) framework and existing optimized C core into an **autonomous physics discovery engine**. The guiding ambition is to *simulate our universe with the minimum necessary active degrees of freedom*—selectively descending toward the smallest meaningful (Planck‑motivated) length/time scales **only where** local informational gain justifies cost—while *searching the rule space itself* for new invariant structures, candidate symmetries, and simplified microphysical interaction forms. VSLA’s rigorously defined shape‑aware semiring algebra eliminates explicit zero‑padding, allowing dynamic birth/death of local degrees of freedom (DoFs) without global reshaping and enabling differentiable + combinatorial optimization directly over changing state and operator graphs. We integrate adaptive multi‑scale refinement, gradient and evolutionary meta‑optimization, symbolic rule rewriting, and automated invariant mining in a reproducible, distributed HPC architecture. Success yields (1) a reference implementation proving that **VSLA fundamentally outperforms traditional padded, ragged, or CSR/COO sparse approaches** for dynamically structured physics, (2) a library of discovered conserved or near‑conserved quantities emerging from rule exploration, and (3) a generalized methodology for minimal‑DoF, maximal‑information simulation across scientific domains.

**Status Context:** The VSLA mathematical framework is *already proven* (theory + prior paper) and an optimized C core library exists and is being prepared for open source release. This proposal covers the *next phase*: applying VSLA to build an adaptive, hypothesis‑generating universe simulator that can (1) efficiently evolve candidate microphysical rules, and (2) autonomously search for new invariants / structures beyond currently encoded physics.

---

## Executive Summary

We will construct an autonomous simulation platform that marries VSLA’s dimension‑aware sparse algebra with large‑scale heterogeneous compute to explore candidate fundamental dynamics. Instead of attempting an infeasible, literal full Planck‑resolution spacetime, we target *adaptive local descent toward sub‑nuclear (and Planck‑motivated) regimes* where needed, while coarser emergent scales are compressed via hierarchical VSLA tensor pyramids. A meta‑optimization loop (gradient‑based + evolutionary + symbolic search) operates over a *rule space* (interaction kernels, semiring compositions, constraint projections) to discover candidate laws consistent with target phenomenology and internal consistency metrics.

## 1. Refined Problem Statement

Classical lattice / grid simulations face three intertwined blockers to exploratory microphysics:

1. **Inflexible Shape & Padding Overhead:** Fixed global shapes materialize vast inactive vacuum regions.
2. **Static Rule Embedding:** Most frameworks hard‑code interaction forms; exploring variants is manual & slow.
3. **Poor Meta‑Learning Hooks:** Traditional sparse formats (CSR, COO, block) lack algebraic closure for seamless differentiable / combinatorial search over changing degrees of freedom.

We seek a platform that *treats both physical state and rule definitions as differentiable, composable objects within a rigorously defined variable‑shape semiring algebra*, enabling:

- Dynamic insertion/removal of local degrees of freedom (DoFs) without global reshaping.
- On‑the‑fly selection of interaction operators (convolutional locality, Kronecker entanglement, custom semirings) guided by performance & fidelity signals.
- Gradient flow through variable‑shape operations plus non‑gradient (evolutionary / symbolic) exploration for discontinuous structural changes.

**Key VSLA Advantage:** Unlike ragged tensors (which loosen shape constraints) or traditional sparse matrices (which discard algebraic structure), VSLA preserves full linear‑algebraic identities *under automatic shape promotion*. This enables formal reasoning (optimization legality, invariant preservation) while retaining sparse‑by‑design efficiency.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

We decompose the platform into **two cooperating macro‑systems**:

1. **HPC Simulation Core (HPC Domain):** Runs the *large, tightly coupled*, latency‑sensitive adaptive simulations (regions undergoing high activity or deep refinement). Emphasis: low‑latency interconnect (InfiniBand / NVLink), NUMA‑aware memory placement, GPU acceleration, deterministic high‑throughput kernels.
2. **Federated Exploration & Orchestration Layer (FEOL Domain):** A *wide, loosely coupled* mesh of orchestrated jobs spanning internal clusters + community donor machines. Emphasis: embarrassingly parallel workloads (parameter sweeps, micro‑universe probes, rule mutation evaluation, invariant validation, post‑processing analytics) with tolerant networking (public internet) and heterogenous hardware.

### 3.3 Data Artifacts & Formats

| Artifact                | Format                                                  | Producer → Consumer Path                              | Notes                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Checkpoint Shard**    | Binary (header + shape table + value blocks + hash)     | HPC Region Manager → Object Store → Community Workers | Delta chains stored with periodic full snapshots. |
| **Rule Graph Diff**     | JSON (node ops, semiring IDs, param deltas) + signature | Mutation Generator → Archive → HPC Gradient Engine    | Signed to prevent tampering.                      |

### 3.4 Execution Lifecycle (Nominal)

```
[1] Initialize Base Rule Graph & State
[2] HPC Core runs High-Fidelity Simulation (N_high steps)
    └─ Emits: checkpoints, telemetry, invariant seeds
[3] FEOL pulls latest checkpoints (thinned) & seeds micro-universe tasks
[4] FEOL evaluates mutations (parallel) → scores & invariant validation
[5] Top k mutations promoted → Rule Graph Diff proposals
[6] HPC applies selected diffs; replays short validation window with gradients
[7] Archive updates (rule version ++); provenance ledger append
[8] Iterate (adaptive refinement/coarsening within HPC each cycle)
```

### 3.5 Communication & Serialization Optimizations

- **Minimal Representative Packing:** Serialize only non‑zero contiguous blocks with run‑length + bitmask for trailing sparse segments.
- **Shape Delta Encoding:** Transmit shape changes as patch operations (add/remove dimension, resize dimension i) rather than full tables.
- **Asynchronous Boundary Futures:** Overlap halo exchange with interior computation; futures resolved before boundary-dependent kernels.
- **Compression Tiering:** LZ4 for halos (low latency), Zstandard for checkpoint archival, optional quantization (8/16‑bit) for *exploratory* micro‑universe seeds (tagged to avoid contaminating high‑fidelity invariants).

### 3.6 Load Balancing Strategy

1. **Predictive Model:** EWMA + small RNN predictor forecasting per‑region compute cost (based on recent ops counts, active DoF growth rate, refinement frequency).
2. **Partition Reassignment:** If predicted imbalance > θ\_lb, migrate least-coupled regions (low boundary traffic) first to minimize halo cost. Migration uses double-buffering with checksum validation.
3. **Refinement Budgeting:** Global controller caps simultaneous refinement expansions to B\_max per cycle; queue over-budget requests prioritized by expected information gain (variance \* inverse compute cost).

### 3.7 Fault Tolerance & Integrity

- **Region-Level Checkpoint Cadence:** Fast incremental (delta) every M steps, full snapshot every K·M steps.
- **Consensus on Rule Promotion:** Quorum (configurable majority) of independent micro‑universe validation scores before high-fidelity adoption.
- **Deterministic Replay:** Identical seeds + version pins reproduce divergent runs for debugging; divergence fingerprint stored if mismatch > ε.
- **Integrity Hash Chain:** Each Rule Graph Diff includes parent hash; checkpoints embed current rule version hash for cross-verification.

### 3.8 Security & Sandbox Considerations (Community Workers)

- Sandboxed execution (WASM / container) limiting syscalls.
- Signed payloads (rule diff, checkpoint shard) verified before execution.
- Resource / result attestation (optional SGX or TPM quote) recorded when available to increase trust in contributed scores.

## 4. Adaptive Multi‑Scale Strategy

- **Refinement Triggers:** (a) Local energy density percentile > τ\_E, (b) Conservation residual > τ\_C, (c) Gradient norm / curvature spike, (d) Emergent pattern novelty score (distance in latent space > τ\_N).
- **Refinement Action:** Subdivide region; promote sub‑region tensors via Σ stacking; reallocate compute to new shards; re‑estimate interaction stencils locally.
- **Coarsening:** If sustained inactivity (all triggers below thresholds for T\_hold steps) collapse children via inverse window aggregation preserving conserved quantities (project via semiring homomorphism ensuring invariants).

---

## 5. Meta‑Rule Search & Autonomous Discovery

### 5.1 Parameter Space

- Continuous: Coupling constants, propagation speeds, mass terms, kernel radii weights, symmetry penalty coefficients.
- Discrete/Structural: Operator sequence ordering, semiring selection, presence/absence of constraint projection, boundary condition types, gauge group candidates (encoded via adjacency / representation metadata), refinement policy parameters.

### 5.2 Optimization Loop

1. **Inner Loop:** Run simulation for N\_inner steps under current rule graph; collect metrics & invariant candidates.
2. **Evaluation:** Score = w₁·(phenomenology fit) + w₂·(invariant stability) + w₃·(computational efficiency) − penalties (violated constraints, divergence growth).
3. **Gradient Phase:** Apply differentiable updates to continuous parameters (Adam / LBFGS over sparse parameter packs) using custom VJPs.
4. **Exploration Phase:** Evolutionary mutations & symbolic rewrites sampled by multi-armed bandit prioritizing operators with large attribution scores from integrated gradients / Shapley approximations.
5. **Selection & Archive:** Pareto frontier archive (accuracy vs. complexity vs. energy usage) maintained to avoid premature convergence.

### 5.3 Invariant / Symmetry Discovery

- Track candidate conserved quantities Q = Σ\_i α\_i f\_i(state) discovered via sparse regression on time-derivative data; validate by rolling window drift statistics.
- Detect approximate symmetries via group action proposals (small perturbations) that minimize state divergence under reconstruction. Promote stable approximate symmetries to explicit projectors (constraint operators) that can guide further search.

| **Reproducibility**   | Determinism divergence                           | Bitwise identical outputs for identical seeds across ≤2 GPU architectures (within tolerance).                                            |

## 9. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| Risk                                      | Impact                   | Mitigation                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overclaiming Planck-scale feasibility     | Credibility              | Frame as *approach toward sub-Planck regimes* via adaptive refinement; emphasize exploratory discovery, not full universe reproduction. |
| Gradient instability with variable shapes | Slows optimization       | Custom VJPs avoiding dense materialization; gradient clipping & shape-change event barriers.                                            |
| Load imbalance with bursty refinement     | Performance collapse     | Dynamic partition reassignment using live DoF density histograms & predictive smoothing.                                                |
| Invariant false positives (noise fits)    | Misguided rule promotion | Cross-validation windows, penalize complexity, require stability over multiple refinement cycles.                                       |
| Serialization overhead                    | Throughput limit         | Binary minimal representation + delta encoding for unchanged shape slices.                                                              |

## 10. Reproducibility & Provenance

- Deterministic kernels selectable (sacrificing some throughput).
- Each simulation run logs: git commit of VSLA & physics kernels, semiring catalog hash, rule graph diff history, RNG seeds, hardware fingerprint.
- Checkpoints: content-addressed (SHA-256) bundles with manifest of shape metadata & parameter vector; provenance graph enabling rollback & lineage queries.

---

## 11. Open Source & Community Strategy

- License: Permissive (MIT / Apache 2.0) to maximize adoption.
- Modular plugin interfaces for new semirings, refinement policies, invariant mining strategies.
- Public benchmark repository & CI including deterministic regression tests and performance tracking across reference GPUs.
- Governance: Lightweight steering group (core maintainers + rotating external reviewers) for rule search contributions.

---

## 12. Ethical & Sustainability Considerations

- **Energy Footprint:** Publish energy metrics per benchmark (kWh / simulated step) and optimize for Joules/DoF-step.
- **Openness vs. Misuse:** Focus is fundamental physics discovery; no direct dual-use risk identified, but we will document limitations.
- **Community Compute Integration:** Idle community nodes limited to parameter sweeps & post-processing to avoid misleading claims of full-scale distributed Planck simulation.

## 13. Future Extensions (Post Phase 5)

1. **Higher-Order Autodiff:** Sparse Hessian / mixed forward-reverse mode for curvature-aware rule fitting.
2. **Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks:** Integrate Kronecker semiring variants with entanglement entropy estimators.
3. **Probabilistic Rule Ensembles:** Bayesian model averaging over rule graphs with stochastic refinement policies.
4. **Differentiable Compiler Passes:** Automatic fusion & kernel generation guided by cost models learned from telemetry.
5. **Invariant Certificates:** Formal verification (SMT / abstract interpretation) for candidate conserved laws on restricted subsystems.
6. **Edge & FPGA Backends:** Low-power subset for localized high-resolution bursts (e.g. near emergent event horizons in simulation).

## 14. Expected Impact

This project operationalizes VSLA from proven algebraic theory into a *practical autonomous physics discovery engine*. Success yields:

- A reference architecture for variable-shape differentiable simulation at scale.
- Novel candidate invariants / simplified interaction forms for toy microphysical models.
- A reusable meta-optimization stack for other domains (chemistry, adaptive PDEs, graph dynamics) where DoF cardinality is intrinsically dynamic.

## 15. Summary

We transition from VSLA’s foundational theory to an applied, adaptive simulation and discovery platform. By unifying sparse-by-design algebra, meta-rule search, and hierarchical refinement under a reproducible HPC framework, we systematically explore new physical structures while maintaining computational tractability. The outcome is not a brute force Planck-scale replica, but an *intelligent, multi-scale engine* that selectively approaches extreme resolutions only where informational yield justifies cost—and learns how the rules themselves might elegantly reorganize.
