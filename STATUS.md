### VSLA Library Status (2025-07-17)

**✅ ARCHITECTURE REFACTORING COMPLETE**

## **Current State**

The VSLA library has been successfully refactored with a unified, backend-driven architecture. The core library compiles cleanly and provides a solid foundation for high-performance tensor operations across CPU and GPU backends.

### **Key Components**

**Unified Tensor Structure**
- Single `vsla_tensor_t` supporting both CPU and GPU data
- Automatic data validity tracking (`cpu_valid`, `gpu_valid`)
- Efficient memory management with backend-specific pointers
- Backward compatibility maintained

**Backend Interface**
- Comprehensive abstraction for all tensor operations
- Function pointers for memory management, arithmetic, linear algebra, reductions
- Designed for single-kernel GPU operations
- Extensible to multiple GPU vendors (CUDA, ROCm, OneAPI)

**Current Implementations**
- ✅ **CPU Backend**: Complete with add, sub, scale, hadamard, fill, sum, mean
- ✅ **CUDA Framework**: Memory management and data transfers implemented
- ✅ **Build System**: Clean compilation of static and shared libraries

## **Development Status**

✅ **Library builds successfully** (static and shared)  
✅ **Clean backend architecture** with unified interface  
✅ **CPU operations working** for basic arithmetic and reductions  
⚠️ **GPU kernels** need implementation (framework ready)  
⚠️ **Unified API** temporarily disabled pending integration  

## **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **GPU Kernel Development** - Implement CUDA kernels for arithmetic operations
2. **Unified API Integration** - Connect new backend interface to high-level API
3. **Test Suite Creation** - Build tests for new architecture
4. **Performance Optimization** - Single-kernel designs and vendor library integration

## **Development Notes**

- Architecture supports multi-GPU and heterogeneous computing
- Backend interface designed for minimal overhead
- Historical development notes available in `docs/archive/`
- Old test suite preserved in `tests/archive/` for reference
